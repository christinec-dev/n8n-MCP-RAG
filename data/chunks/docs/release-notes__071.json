Now you can get a clearer path to trace executions, troubleshoot issues, and understand the behavior of a complete workflow ‚Äî without bouncing between node detail views. \n\nThis update brings a unified, always-accessible panel to the bottom of the canvas, showing you each step of the execution as it happens. Whether you're working with loops, sub-workflows, or AI agents, you‚Äôll see a structured view of everything that ran, in the order it ran‚Äîwith input, output, and status info right where you need it.\n\nYou can jump into node details when you want to dig deeper, or follow a single item through every step it touched. Real-time highlighting shows you which nodes are currently running or have failed, and you‚Äôll see total execution time for any workflow‚Äîplus token usage for AI workflows to help monitor performance. And if you're debugging across multiple screens? Just pop the logs out and drag them wherever you‚Äôd like.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è**What it does**\n\n- Adds a **Logs view** to the bottom of the canvas that can be opened or collapsed. (Chat also appears here if your workflow uses it).\n- Displays a **hierarchical list of nodes** in the order they were executed‚Äîincluding expanded views of sub-workflows.\n- Allows you to **click a node in hierarchy** to preview inputs and outputs directly, or jump into the full Node Details view with a link.\n- Provides ability to **toggle** input and output data on and off.\n- Highlights each node **live as it runs**, showing when it starts, completes, or fails.\n- Includes **execution history** view to explore past execution data in a similar way.\n- Shows **roll-up stats** like total execution time and total AI tokens used (for AI-enabled workflows).\n- Includes a  **‚Äúpop out‚Äù** button to open the logs as a floating window‚Äîperfect for dragging to another screen while debugging.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è**How to**\n\nTo access the expanded logs view, click on the Logs bar at the bottom of the canvas. The view is also opens up when you open the chat window on the bottom of the page."
