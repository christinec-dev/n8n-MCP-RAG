This makes it easier to implement model routing strategies, such as switching models based on performance, task type, cost, or availability.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è **How to:** Connect multiple model nodes to the Model Selector node, then configure routing conditions in the node‚Äôs settings.\n\nüß† **Keep in mind:** \n\n- Rules are evaluated in order. The first matching rule determines which model is used even if others would also match.\n- As a sub-node, expressions behave differently here: they always resolves to the first item rather than resolving for each item in turn.\n\nThe Model Selector node is especially useful in evaluation or production scenarios where routing logic between models needs to adapt based on performance, cost, availability, or dataset-specific needs.\n\n<br>\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n    ![Model Selector node](/_images/release-notes/Model_selector_node.png)\n    <figcaption>Model Selector node</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br>"
