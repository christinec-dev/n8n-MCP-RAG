There are still standalone nodes for [HTML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html.md) and [XML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml.md).\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"n8n-new-features\" markdown>\n\n#### New node: Qdrant vector store\n\nThis release adds support for [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) with the Qdrant vector store node.\n\nRead n8n's [Qdrant vector store node documentation](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoreqdrant.md)\n\n</div>"
