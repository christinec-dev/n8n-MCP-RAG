Or share a credential in a [project](/glossary.md#project-n8n) for all members of that project to use. Any users using a shared credential won't be able to view or edit the credential details.\n\nUsers can share credentials they created and own. Only project admins can share credentials created in and owned by a project. Instance owners and instance admins can view and share all credentials on an instance.\n\nRefer to [Account types](/user-management/account-types.md) for more information about owners and admins.\n\nIn [projects](/user-management/rbac/index.md), a user's role controls how they can interact with the workflows and credentials associated to the projects they're a member of."
