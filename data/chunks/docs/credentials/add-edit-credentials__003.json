If your n8n instance supports [projects](/glossary.md#project-n8n), you'll also need to choose whether to create the credential inside your personal space or a specific project you have access to.

Select the app or service you wish to connect to.\n\nYou can also create new credential in the credential drop down when editing a node on the workflow editor.\n\nOnce in the credential modal, enter the details required by your service. Refer to your service's page in the [credentials library](/integrations/builtin/credentials/index.md) for guidance.\n\nWhen you save a credential, n8n tests it to confirm it works.\n\n/// note | Credentials naming\nn8n names new credentials \"*node name* account\" by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app or service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.\n///"
