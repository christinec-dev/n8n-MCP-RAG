Now you can access a select set of community nodes and partner integrations without leaving the canvas. This means you install and automate with a wider range of integrations without leaving your workspace. The power of the community is now built-in.\n\nThis update focuses on three major improvements:\n\n- **Cloud availability**: Community nodes are no longer just for self-hosted users. A select set of nodes is now available on n8n Cloud.\n- **Built-in discovery**: You can find and explore these nodes right from the Nodes panel without leaving the editor or searching on npm.\n- **Trust and verification**: Nodes that appear in the editor have been manually vetted for quality and security. These verified nodes are marked with a checkmark.\n\nWe‚Äôre starting with a selection of around 25 nodes, including some of the most-used community-built packages and partner-supported integrations. For this phase, we focused on nodes that don‚Äôt include external package dependencies - helping streamline the review process and ensure a smooth rollout.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nThis is just the start. We plan to expand the library gradually, bringing even more verified nodes into the editor along with the powerful and creative use cases they unlock. In time, our criteria will evolve, opening the door to a wider range of contributions while keeping quality and security in focus.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nLearn more about this update and find out which nodes are already installable from the editor in our [blog](https://blog.n8n.io/community-nodes-available-on-n8n-cloud/) post. \n\n<br>\n\n üíª **Use a verified node**\n\nMake sure you're on **n8n version 1.94.0** or later and the instance Owner has enabled verified community nodes. On Cloud, this can be done from the Admin Panel. For self-hosted instances, please refer to [documentation](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes.md). In both cases, verified nodes are enabled by default.\n\n- Open the **Nodes panel** from the editor\n- Search for the Node. Verified nodes are indicated by a shield üõ°Ô∏è\n- Select the node and click **Install**\n\n<br>\n<video src=\"/_video/release-notes/Community-nodes-node-panel.mp4\" controls width=\"100%\"></video>\n<br>\n\nOnce an Owner installs a node, everyone on the instance can start using it‚Äîjust drag, drop, and connect like any other node in your workflow.\n\n<br>\n\nüõ†Ô∏è **Build a node and get it verified**\n\nWant your node to be verified and discoverable from the editor? Here‚Äôs how to get involved:\n\n1. Review the [community node verification guidelines](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/verification-guidelines.md).\n2. If you‚Äôre building something new, follow the recommendations for [creating nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/overview.md).\n3. Check your design against the [UX guidelines](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ux-guidelines.md).\n4. [Submit your node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes.md) to npm.\n5. Request verification by filling out [this form](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/form/f0ff9304-f34a-420e-99da-6103a2f8ac5b).\n\n<br>\n\n**Already built a node? Raise your hand!**\n\nIf you‚Äôve already published a community node and want it considered for verification, make sure it meets the requirements noted above, then let us know by submitting the interest [form](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/form/f0ff9304-f34a-420e-99da-6103a2f8ac5b). We‚Äôre actively curating the next batch and would"
