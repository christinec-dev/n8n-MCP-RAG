Many providers - both established or new - are adopting MCP as a standard way to build agentic systems. It is an easy way to either expose your own app as a server, making capabilities available to a model as tools, or as a client that can call on tools outside of your own system. <br>\n\nWhile itâ€™s still early in the development process, we want to give you access to our new MCP nodes. This will help us understand your requirements better and will also let us converge on a great general solution quicker. <br>\n\nWe are adding two new nodes: \n\n- a MCP [Server Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger.md) for any workflow  \n- a MCP [Client Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp.md) for the AI Agent  \n\nThe MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. You can run multiple MCP servers from your n8n instance. The MCP Client Tool connects LLMs - and other intelligent agents - to any MCP-enabled service through a single interface. <br>\n\nMax from our DevRel team created an official walkthrough for you to get started: \n\n<br>\n\n[![Studio](/_images/release-notes/MCP-YouTube-thumb.jpg)](https://youtu.be/45WPU7P-1QQ?feature=shared)\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n    <figcaption>[Studio Update #04](https://youtu.be/45WPU7P-1QQ?feature=shared)</figcaption>\n</figure>"
