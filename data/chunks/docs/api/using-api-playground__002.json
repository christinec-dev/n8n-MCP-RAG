It's available for all self-hosted pricing tiers.\n///\n\nThe n8n API comes with a built-in Swagger UI playground in self-hosted versions. This provides interactive documentation, where you can try out requests. The path to access the playground depends on your hosting.\n\nn8n constructs the path from values set in your environment variables:\n\n```shell\nN8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/docs\n```\n\nThe API version number is `1`. There may be multiple versions available in the future.\n\n/// warning | Real data\nIf you select **Authorize** and enter your API key in the API playground, you have access to your live data. This is useful for trying out requests. Be aware you can change or delete real data.\n///\nThe API includes built-in documentation about credential formats. This is available using the `credentials` endpoint:\n\n```shell\nN8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/credentials/schema/{credentialTypeName}\n```\n\n/// note | How to find `credentialTypeName`\nTo find the type, download your workflow as JSON and examine it. For example, for a Google Drive node the `{credentialTypeName}` is `googleDriveOAuth2Api`:\n```json\n{\n    ...,\n    \"credentials\": {\n        \"googleDriveOAuth2Api\": {\n        \"id\": \"9\",\n        \"name\": \"Google Drive\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n///"
