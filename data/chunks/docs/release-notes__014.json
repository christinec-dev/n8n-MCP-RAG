  "content": "### Webhook HTML responses\n\nStarting with this release, if your workflow sends an HTML response to a webhook, n8n automatically wraps the content in an `<iframe>`. This is a security mechanism to protect the instance users.\n\nThis has the following implications:\n\n- HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe instead of directly in the parent document.\n- JavaScript code that attempts to access the top-level window or local storage will fail.\n- Authentication headers aren't available in the sandboxed iframe (for example, basic auth). You need to use an alternative approach, like embedding a short-lived access token within the HTML.\n- Relative URLs (for example, `<form action=\"/\">`) won't work. Use absolute URLs instead.\n\n<div class=\"n8n-new-features\" markdown>"
