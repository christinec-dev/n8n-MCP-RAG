These enhancements provide more flexibility and customization, enabling teams to create visually engaging and highly functional workflows with forms.\n\n- **HTML customization:** Add custom HTML to forms, including embedded images and videos, for richer user experiences.  \n- **Custom CSS support**: Apply custom styles to user-facing components to align forms with your brand’s look and feel. Adjust fonts, colors, and spacing for a seamless visual identity.\n- **Form previews:** Your form’s description and title will pull into previews of your form when sharing on social media or messaging apps, providing a more polished look.  \n- **Hidden fields:** Use query parameters to add hidden fields, allowing you to pass data—such as a referral source—without exposing it to the user.  \n- **New responses options:** Respond to user submissions in multiple ways including text, HTML, or a downloadable file (binary format). This enables forms to display rich webpages or deliver digital assets such as dynamically generated invoices or personalized certificates.  \n\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n    ![Form with custom CSS applied](/_images/release-notes/Forms_with_custom_CSS_and_HTML.png)\n    <figcaption>Form with custom CSS applied</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br>\n\nThese improvements elevate the Form Trigger node beyond a simple workflow trigger, transforming it into a powerful tool for addressing use cases from data collection and order processing to custom content creation."
