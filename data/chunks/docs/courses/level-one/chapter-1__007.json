It displays several icons and a node with different functionalities:\n\n- Buttons to zoom the canvas to fit the screen, zoom in or out of the canvas, and tidy up the nodes on screen.\n- A button to **Execute workflow** once you add your first node. When you click on it, n8n executes all nodes on the canvas in sequence.\n- A button with a **+** sign inside. This button opens the nodes panel.\n- A button with a note icon inside. This button adds a [sticky note](/workflows/components/sticky-notes.md) to the canvas (visible when hovering on the top right + icon).\n- A dotted square with the text \"Add first step.\" This is where you add your first node.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-canvas.png\" alt=\"Workflow canvas\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow canvas</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n/// note | Moving the canvas\nYou can move the workflow canvas around in three ways:\n\n- Select ++ctrl+left-button++ on the canvas and move it around.\n- Select ++middle-button++ on the canvas and move it around.\n- Place two fingers on your touchpad and slide.\n///\n\n\nDon't worry about workflow execution and activation for now; we'll explain these concepts later on in the course."
