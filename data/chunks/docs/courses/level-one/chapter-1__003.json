This is an advanced option recommended only for technical users familiar with hosting services, Docker, and the command line.\n///\n\nFor more details on the different ways to set up n8n, see our [platforms documentation](/choose-n8n.md#platforms).\n\nOnce you have n8n running, open the Editor UI in a browser window. Log in to your n8n instance. Select **Overview** and then **Create Workflow** to view the main canvas.\n\nIt should look like this:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-editor-ui.png\" alt=\"Editor UI\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Editor UI</i></figcaption></figure>"
