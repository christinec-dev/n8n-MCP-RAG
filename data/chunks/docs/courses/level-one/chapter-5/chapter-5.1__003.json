But not all apps or services have dedicated nodes, like the legacy data warehouse from Nathan's company.\n\nThough we can't directly export the data, Nathan told us that the data warehouse has a couple of API endpoints. That's all we need to access the data using the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node in n8n.\n\n/// note | No node for that service?\nThe HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes, allowing you to make HTTP requests to query data from apps and services. You can use it to access data from apps or services that don't have a dedicated node in n8n.\n///"
