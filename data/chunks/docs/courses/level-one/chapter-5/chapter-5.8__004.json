You should leave this set to `v1` if you don't have workflows that rely on the legacy execution ordering.\n- [**Error Workflow**](/flow-logic/error-handling.md): A workflow to run if the execution of the current workflow fails.\n- **This workflow can be called by**: Workflows allowed to call this workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow.md).\n- **Timezone**: The timezone to use in the current workflow. If not set, the global timezone. In particular, this setting is important for the [Schedule Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md), as you want to make sure that the workflow gets executed at the right time.\n- **Save failed production executions**: If n8n should save the Execution data of the workflow when it fails. Default is to save.\n- **Save successful production executions**: If n8n should save the Execution data of the workflow when it succeeds. Default is to save.\n- **Save manual executions**: If n8n should save executions started from the Editor UI. Default is to save.\n- **Save execution progress**: If n8n should save the execution data of each node. If set to Save, you can resume the workflow from where it stopped in case of an error, though keep in mind that this might make the execution slower. Default is to not save.\n- **Timeout Workflow**: Whether to cancel a workflow execution after a specific period of time. Default is to not timeout."
