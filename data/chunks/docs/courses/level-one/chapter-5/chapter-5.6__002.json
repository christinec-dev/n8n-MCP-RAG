Notifying the Team\n\nIn this step of the workflow, you will learn how to send messages to a Discord channel using the [Discord node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/index.md). After this step, your workflow should look like this:\n\n[[ workflowDemo(\"file:////courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.6.json\") ]]\n\nNow that you have a calculated summary of the booked orders, you need to notify Nathan's team in their Discord channel. For this workflow, you will send messages to the [n8n server](https://discord.gg/G98WXzsjky) on Discord.\n\nBefore you begin the steps below, use the link above to connect to the n8n server on Discord. Be sure you can access the `#course-level-1` channel.\n\n/// note | Communication app nodes\nYou can replace the Discord node with another communication app. For example, n8n also has nodes for [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack.md) and [Mattermost](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost.md).\n///\n\nIn your workflow, add a Discord node connected to the Code node.\n\nWhen you search for the Discord node, look for **Message Actions** and select **Send a message** to add the node.\n\nIn the Discord node window, configure these parameters:\n\n- **Connection Type**: Select **Webhook**.\n- **Credential for Discord Webhook**: Select **- Create New Credential -**.\n    - Copy the **Webhook URL** from the email you received when you signed up for this course and paste it into the **Webhook URL** field of the credentials.\n    - Select **Save** and then close the credentials dialog.\n- **Operation**: Select **Send a Message**.\n- **Message**:\n    - Select the **Expression** tab on the right side of the Message field.\n    - Copy the text below and paste it into the **Expression** window, or construct it manually using the **Expression Editor**.\n\t\t```\n\t\tThis week we've {{$json[\"totalBooked\"]}} booked orders with a total value of {{$json[\"bookedSum\"]}}. My Unique ID: {{ $('HTTP Request').params[\"headerParameters\"][\"parameters\"][0][\"value\"] }}\n\t\t```\n\nNow select **Execute step** in the Discord node. If all works well, you should see this output in n8n:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-6-discord-output.png\" alt=\"Discord node output\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Discord node output</i></figcaption></figure>\n\nAnd your message should appear in the Discord channel #course-level-1:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/discord-output.png\" alt=\"Discord message\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Discord message</i></figcaption></figure>"
