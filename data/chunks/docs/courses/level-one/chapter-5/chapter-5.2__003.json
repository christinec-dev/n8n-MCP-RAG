[Create an Airtable account](https://airtable.com/signup).\n2. In your Airtable workspace add a new base from scratch and name it, for example, *beginner course*.\n\n\t<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-create-airtable-base.png\" alt=\"Create an Airtable base\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Create an Airtable base</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n3. In the beginner course base, by default, you have a table called **Table 1** with four fields: `Name`, `Notes`, `Assignee`, and `Status`.  These fields aren't relevant for us since they aren't in our \"orders\" data set. This brings us to the next point: the names of the fields in Airtable have to match the names of the columns in the node result. Prepare the table by doing the following:\n\n\t* Rename the table from **Table 1** to **orders** to make it easier to identify.\n\t* Delete the 3 blank records created by default.\n\t* Delete the `Notes`, `Assignee`, and `Status` fields.\n\t* Edit the `Name` field (the primary field) to read `orderID`, with the **Number** field type.\n\t* Add the rest of the fields, and their field types, using the table below as a reference:\n\n\t | Field name     | Field type       |\n\t |----------------|------------------|\n\t | `orderID`      | Number           |\n\t | `customerID`   | Number           |\n\t | `employeeName` | Single line text |\n\t | `orderPrice`   | Number           |\n\t | `orderStatus`  | Single line text |\n\n\nNow your table should look like this:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-orders-table.png\" alt=\"Orders table in Airtable\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Orders table in Airtable</i></figcaption></figure>\n\nNow that the table is ready, let's return to the workflow in the n8n Editor UI."
