Scheduling the Workflow\n\nIn this step of the workflow, you will learn how to schedule your workflow so that it runs automatically at a set time/interval using the Schedule Trigger node. After this step, your workflow should look like this:\n\n[[ workflowDemo(\"file:////courses/level-one/finished.json\") ]]\n\nThe workflow you've built so far executes only when you click on **Execute Workflow**. But Nathan needs it to run automatically every Monday morning. You can do this with the [Schedule Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md), which allows you to schedule workflows to run periodically at fixed dates, times, or intervals.\n\nTo achieve this, we'll remove the Manual Trigger node we started with and replace it with a Schedule Trigger node instead."
