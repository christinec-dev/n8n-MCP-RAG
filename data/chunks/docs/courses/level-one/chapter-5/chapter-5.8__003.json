The execution log is useful for debugging your workflow and seeing at what stage it runs into issues.\n\nTo view the executions for a specific workflow, you can switch to the **Executions** tab when the workflow is open on the canvas. Use the **Editor** tab to swap back to the node editor.\n\nTo see the execution log for the entire n8n instance, in your Editor UI, select **Overview** and then select the **Executions** tab in the main panel.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-execution-list.png\" alt=\"Execution List\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Execution List</i></figcaption></figure>\n\nThe **Executions** window displays a table with the following information:\n\n- **Name**: The name of the workflow\n- **Started At**: The date and time when the workflow started\n- **Status**: The status of the workflow (Waiting, Running, Succeeded, Cancelled, or Failed) and the amount of time it took the workflow to execute\n- **Execution ID**: The ID of this workflow execution\n\n/// note | Workflow execution status\nYou can filter the displayed **Executions** by workflow and by status (**Any Status**, **Failed**, **Cancelled**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**).\nThe information displayed here depends on which executions you configure to save in the [**Workflow Settings**](/workflows/settings.md).\n///"
