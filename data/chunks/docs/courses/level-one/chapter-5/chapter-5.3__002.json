Filtering Orders\n\nIn this step of the workflow, you will learn how to filter data using conditional logic and how to use expressions in nodes using the [If node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if.md).\n\nAfter this step, your workflow should look like this:\n\n[[ workflowDemo(\"file:////courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3.json\") ]]\n\nTo insert only processing orders into Airtable we need to filter our data by `orderStatus`. Basically, we want to tell the program that _if_ the `orderStatus` is processing, _then_ insert all records with this status into Airtable; _else_, for example, if the `orderStatus` isn't *processing*, calculate the sum of all orders with the other `orderStatus` (`booked`).\n\nThis if-then-else command is conditional logic. In n8n workflows, you can add conditional logic with the [If node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if.md), which splits a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.\n\n/// note | If vs. Switch\nIf you need to filter data on more than boolean values (true and false), use the [Switch node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch.md). The Switch node is similar to the If node, but supports multiple output connectors.\n///"
