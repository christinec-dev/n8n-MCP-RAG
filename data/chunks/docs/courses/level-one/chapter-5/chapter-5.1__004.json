The node window will open, where you need to configure some parameters.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node.png\" alt=\"HTTP Request node\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>HTTP Request node</i></figcaption></figure>\n\nThis node will use credentials.\n\n/// note | Credentials\n[Credentials](/glossary.md#credential-n8n) are unique pieces of information that identify a user or a service and allow them to access apps or services (in our case, represented as n8n nodes). A common form of credentials is a username and a password, but they can take other forms depending on the service.\n///\n\nIn this case, you'll need the credentials for the ABCorp data warehouse API included in the email from n8n you received when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up yet, [sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI).\n\nIn the **Parameters** of the HTTP Request node, make the following adjustments:\n\n- **Method**: This should default to GET. Make sure it's set to GET.\n- **URL**: Add the **Dataset URL** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n- **Send Headers**: Toggle this control to true. In **Specify Headers**, ensure **Using Fields Below** is selected.\n    - **Header Parameters** > **Name**: Enter `unique_id`.\n    - **Header Parameters** > **Value**: The Unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n- **Authentication**: Select **Generic Credential Type**. This option requires credentials before allowing you to access the data.\n    - **Generic Auth Type**: Select **Header Auth**. (This field will appear after you select the Generic Credential Type for the Authentication.)\n    - **Credential for Header Auth**: To add your credentials, select **+ Create new credential**. This will open the Credentials window.\n    - In the Credentials window, set **Name** to be the **Header Auth name** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n    - In the Credentials window, set **Value** to be the **Header Auth value** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n    - Select the **Save** button in the Credentials window to save your credentials. Your **Credentials Connection** window should look like this:\n    <figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node-credentials.png\" alt=\"HTTP Request node credentials\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>HTTP Request node credentials</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n/// note | Credentials naming\nNew credential names follow the \"<node name> account\" format by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app/service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.\n///\n\nOnce you save, exit out of the Credentials window to return to the HTTP Request node."
