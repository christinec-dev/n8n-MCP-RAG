Refer to the [Action nodes library](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/index.md) for a full list of these nodes.\n- **Trigger Nodes** start a workflow and supply the initial data. Refer to the [Trigger nodes library](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/index.md) for a list of trigger nodes.\n- **Core Nodes** can be trigger or app nodes. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls. Refer to the [Core Nodes library](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/index.md) for a full list of core nodes.\n- **Cluster Nodes** are node groups that work together to provide functionality in a workflow, primarily for AI workflows. Refer to [Cluster nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/index.md) for more information.\n\n/// note | Learn more\nRefer to [Node types](/integrations/builtin/node-types.md) for a more detailed explanation of all node types.\n///"
