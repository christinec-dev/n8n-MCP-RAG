You can switch between these views by selecting the one you want from the **Table | JSON | Schema** button at the top of the node window.\n\n/// note | Table vs JSON views\nThe **Table** view is the default. It displays the requested data in a table, where the rows are the records and the columns are the available attributes of those records.\n///\n\nHere's our Hacker News output in JSON view:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-results-in-json-view-for-the-hacker-news-node.png\" alt=\"Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node</i></figcaption></figure>\n\nThe node window displays more information about the node execution:\n\n- Next to the **Output** title, notice a small icon (this will be a green checkmark if the node execution succeeded). Beside it, there is an info icon. If you hover on it, you'll get two more pieces of information that can provide insights into the performance of each individual node in a workflow:\n    - **Start Time**: When the node execution started.\n    - **Execution Time**: How long it took for the node to return the results from the moment it started executing.\n- Just below the **Output** title, you'll notice another piece of information: **10 items**. This field displays the number of items (records) that the node request returned. In this example, it's expected to be 10, since this is the limit we set in step 2. But if you don't set a limit, it's useful to see how many records are actually returned.\n\n\n/// warning | Error in nodes\nA red warning icon on a node means that the node has errors. This might happen if the node credentials are missing or incorrect or the node parameters aren't configured correctly.\n///\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/error-node.png\" alt=\"Error in nodes\" style=\"width:30%\" align=\"center\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Error in nodes</i></figcaption></figure>"
