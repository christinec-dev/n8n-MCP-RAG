This could include removing duplicate data or updating data in one system when it changes in another.\n\n/// note | One-way vs. two-way sync\nIn a one-way sync, data is synchronized in one direction. One system serves as the single source of truth. When information changes in that main system, it automatically changes in the secondary system; but if information changes in the secondary system, the changes aren't reflected in the main system.\n\nIn a two-way sync, data is synchronized in both directions (between both systems). When information changes in either of the two systems, it automatically changes in the other one as well.\n\n[This blog tutorial](https://blog.n8n.io/how-to-sync-data-between-two-systems/) explains how to sync data one-way and two-way between two CRMs.\n///\n\n\nIn n8n, you can merge data from two different nodes using the [Merge node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md), which provides several merging options:\n\n- [Append](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md#append)\n- [Combine](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md#combine)\n\t- [Merge by Fields](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md#combine-by-matching-fields): requires input fields to match on\n\t- [Merge by Position](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md#combine-by-position)\n\t- [Combine all possible combinations](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md#combine-by-all-possible-combinations)\n- [Choose Branch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md#choose-branch)\n\nNotice that Combine > Merge by Fields requires you enter input fields to match on. These fields should contain identical values between the data sources so n8n can properly match data together. In the **Merge node**, they're called `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/explanation_mergepropertyinput.png\" alt=\"Property Input fields in the Merge node\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Property Input fields in the Merge node</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n/// warning | Property Input in dot notation\nIf you want to reference nested values in the **Merge node** parameters `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`, you need to enter the property key in dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression).\n///\n\n/// note\nYou can also find the **Merge node** under the alias Join. This might be more intuitive if you're familiar with SQL joins.\n///"
