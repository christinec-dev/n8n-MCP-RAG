Use the [**If node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if.md) to filter to only display orders from the region `Americas`.\n2. Use the [**Convert to File**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile.md) to transform the incoming data from JSON to binary format. Convert each item to a separate file. (Bonus points if you can figure out how to name each report based on the orderID!)\n3. Use the [**Gmail node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/index.md) (or another email node) to send the files using email to an address you have access to. Note that you need to add an attachment with the data property.\n4. Use the [**Discord node**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/index.md) to send a message in the n8n Discord channel `#course-level-two`. In the node, configure the following parameters:\n    * **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n    * **Text**: \"I sent the file using email with the label ID `{label ID}`. My ID: \" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course. <br/> Note that you need to replace the text in curly braces `{}` with [expressions](/glossary.md#expression-n8n) that reference the data from the nodes.\n\n/// question | Quiz questions\n* How many orders are assigned to the `Americas` region?\n* What's the total price of the orders in the `Americas` region?\n* How many items does the **Write Binary File node** return?\n///"
