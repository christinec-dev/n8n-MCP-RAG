Sort the data and format the dates.\n3. Write binary files.\n4. Send notifications using email and Discord.\n\nn8n provides [core nodes](/integrations/builtin/node-types.md#core-nodes) for all these steps. This use case is somewhat complex. We should build it from three separate workflows:\n\n1. A workflow that merges the company data with external information.\n2. A workflow that generates the reports.\n3. A workflow that monitors errors in the second workflow."
