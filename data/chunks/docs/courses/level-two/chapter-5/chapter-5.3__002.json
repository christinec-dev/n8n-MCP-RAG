Create a new workflow.\n2. Add an **Error Trigger node** (and execute it as a test).\n3. Connect a **Discord node** to the **Error Trigger node** and configure these fields:<br/>\n\n\t* **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL that you received in the email from n8n when you signed up for this course.\n\t* **Text**: \"The workflow `{workflow name}` failed, with the error message: `{execution error message}`. Last node executed: `{name of the last executed node}`. Check this workflow execution here: `{execution URL}` My Unique ID: \" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.\n\n\t\tNote that you need to replace the text in curly brackets `{}` with expressions that take the respective information from the Error Trigger node.<br/>\n\n4. Execute the Discord node.\n5. Set the newly created workflow as the **Error Workflow** for the main workflow you created in the previous lesson.\n\nThe workflow should look like this:\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow3.png\" alt=\"Workflow 3 for monitoring workflow errors\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow 3 for monitoring workflow errors</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n/// question | Quiz questions\n* What fields does the **Error Trigger node** return?\n* What information about the execution does the **Error Trigger node** return?\n* What information about the workflow does the **Error Trigger node** return?\n* What's the expression to reference the workflow name?\n///"
