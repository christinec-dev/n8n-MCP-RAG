The dates and times can be passed in different formats, for example:\n<!-- vale off -->\n- `DATE`: March 29 2022, 29-03-2022, 2022/03/29\n- `TIME`: 08:30:00, 8:30, 20:30\n- `DATETIME`: 2022/03/29 08:30:00\n- `TIMESTAMP`: 1616108400 (Unix timestamp), 1616108400000 (Unix ms timestamp)\n- `YEAR`: 2022, 22\n<!-- vale on -->\nThere are a few ways you can work with dates and times:\n\n- Use the [**Date & Time node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime.md) to convert date and time data to different formats and calculate dates.\n- Use [**Schedule Trigger node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md) to schedule workflows to run at a specific time, interval, or duration.\n\nSometimes, you might need to pause the workflow execution. This might be necessary if you know that a service doesn't process the data instantly or it's slow to return all the results. In these cases, you don't want n8n to pass incomplete data to the next node.\n\nIf you run into situations like this, use the [**Wait node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait.md) after the node that you want to delay. The **Wait node** pauses the workflow execution and will resume execution:\n\n- At a specific time.\n- After a specified time interval.\n- On a webhook call."
