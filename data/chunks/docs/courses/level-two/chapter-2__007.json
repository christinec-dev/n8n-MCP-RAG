Then, if the calculated date occurred after 1959, the workflow waits 1 minute before [setting](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md) the calculated date as a value. The workflow should be triggered every 30 minutes.\n\n\nTo begin:\n<!-- To do: need to figure out what the actual desired output is here since Date & Time options have changed and I'm unclear what the Set node should be doing-->\n1. Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected. Return All.\n2. Add the **Date & Time node** to Round Up the created Date from the datastore to End of Month. Output this to field new-date. Include all input fields.\n3. Add the **If node** to check if that new rounded date is after `1960-01-01 00:00:00`.\n4. Add the **Wait node** to the True output of that node and set it to wait for one minute.\n5. Add the **Edit Fields (Set) node** to set a new field called outputValue to a String containing new-date. Include all input fields.\n6. Add the **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow to trigger it every 30 minutes. (You can keep the [Manual Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger.md) for testing!)\n\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n\n\t1. Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected.\n\t\t- Select the option to **Return All**.\n\t2. Add a **Date & Time node** connected to the Customer Datastore node. Select the option to **Round a Date**.\n\t\t- Add the `created` date as the **Date** to round.\n\t\t- Select `Round Up` as the **Mode** and `End of Month` as the **To**.\n\t\t- Set the **Output Field Name** as `new-date`.\n\t\t- In **Options**, select **Add Option** and use the control to **Include Input Fields**\n\t3. Add an **If node** connected to the **Date & Time node**.\n\t\t- Add the new-date field as the first part of the condition.\n\t\t- Set the comparison to **Date &Time > is after**\n\t\t- Add `1960-01-01 00:00:00` as the second part of the expression. (This should produce 3 items in the True Branch and 2 items in the False Branch)\n\t4. Add a **Wait node** to the True output of the **If node**.\n\t\t- Set **Resume** to `After Time interval`.\n\t\t- Set **Wait Amount** to `1.00`.\n\t\t- Set **Wait Unit** to `Minutes`.\n\t5. Add an **Edit Fields (Set) node** to the **Wait node**.\n\t\t- Use either JSON or Manual Mapping **Mode**.\n\t\t- Set a new field called `outputValue` to be the value of the new-date field.\n\t\t- Select the option to **Include Other Input Fields** and include **All** fields.\n\t6. Add a **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow.\n\t\t- Set the **Trigger Interval** to use `Minutes`.\n\t\t- Set the **Minutes Between Triggers** to 30.\n\t\t- To test your schedule, be sure to activate the workflow.\n\t\t- Be sure to connect this node to the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** you began with!\n\n\tThe"
