XML looks similar to HTML, but the tag names are different, as they describe the kind of data they hold.\n///\nIf you need to process HTML or XML data in your n8n workflows, use the [**HTML node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html.md) or the [**XML node**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml.md).\n\nUse the **HTML node** to extract HTML content of a webpage by referencing CSS selectors. This is useful if you want to collect structured information from a website (web-scraping)."
