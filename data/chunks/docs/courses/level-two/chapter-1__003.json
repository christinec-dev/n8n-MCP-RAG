The nodes allow you to access (extract) data from multiple disparate sources, modify (transform) that data in a particular way, and pass (load) it along to where it needs to be.\n\nThe data that moves along from node to node in your workflow must be in a format (structure) that can be recognized and interpreted by each node. In n8n, this required structure is an array of objects.\n\n/// note | About array of objects\nAn array is a list of values. The array can be empty or contain several elements. Each element is stored at a position (index) in the list, starting at 0, and can be referenced by the index number. For example, in the array `[\"Leonardo\", \"Michelangelo\", \"Donatello\", \"Raphael\"];` the element `Donatello` is stored at index 2.\n\nAn object stores key-value pairs, instead of values at numbered indexes as in arrays. The order of the pairs isn't important, as the values can be accessed by referencing the key name. For example, the object below contains two properties (`name` and `color`):\n\n```json\n{\n\tname: 'Michelangelo',\n\tcolor: 'blue',\n}\n```\n\nAn array of objects is an array that contains one or more objects. For example, the array `turtles` below contains four objects:\n\n```javascript\nvar turtles = [\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'Michelangelo',\n\t\tcolor: 'orange',\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'Donatello',\n\t\tcolor: 'purple',\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'Raphael',\n\t\tcolor: 'red',\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tname: 'Leonardo',\n\t\tcolor: 'blue',\n\t}\n];\n```\n\nYou can access the properties of an object using dot notation with the syntax `object.property`. For example, `turtles[1].color` gets the color of the second turtle.\n///\n\n\nData sent from one node to another is sent as an array of JSON objects. The elements in this collection are called items.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/explanation_items.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Items</i></figcaption></figure>\n\nAn n8n node performs its action on each item of incoming data.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Items in the Customer Datastore node</i></figcaption></figure>"
