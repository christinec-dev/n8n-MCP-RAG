The Executions log shows you a list of the latest execution time, status, mode, and running time of your saved workflows.\n\nOpen the Executions log by selecting [**Executions**](/workflows/executions/index.md#execution-modes) in the left-side panel. \n\nTo investigate a specific failed execution from the list, select the name or the **View** button that appears when you hover over the row of the respective execution.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/explanation_workflowexecutions.png\" alt=\"Executions log\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Executions log</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n\nThis will open the workflow in read-only mode, where you can see the execution of each node. This representation can help you identify at what point the workflow ran into issues.\n\nTo toggle between viewing the execution and the editor, select the **Editor | Executions** button at the top of the page.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/explanation_workflowexecutions_readonly.png\" alt=\"Workflow execution view\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow execution view</i></figcaption></figure>"
