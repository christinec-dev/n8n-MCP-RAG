The node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools. This means your n8n workflows and integrations are now available to models run elsewhere. Pretty neat. \n\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n    ![MCP Server Trigger](/_images/release-notes/MCP-Server-Trigger.png)\n    <figcaption>MCP Server Trigger</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n[Explore the MCP Server Trigger docs](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger.md)"
