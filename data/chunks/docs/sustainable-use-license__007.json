In practice this means all use is allowed unless you are selling a product, service, or module in which the value derives entirely or substantially from n8n functionality. Here are some examples that wouldn't be allowed:\n\n* White-labeling n8n and offering it to your customers for money.\n* Hosting n8n and charging people money to access it.\n\nAll of the following examples are allowed under our license: \n\n* Using n8n to sync the data you control as a company, for example from a CRM to an internal database.\n* Creating an n8n node for your product or any other integration between your product and n8n.\n* Providing consulting services related to n8n, for example building workflows, custom features closely connect to n8n, or code that gets executed by n8n.\n* Supporting n8n, for example by setting it up or maintaining it on an internal company server.\n\n#### Can I use n8n to act as the back-end to power a feature in my app?\n\nUsually yes, as long as the back-end process doesn't use users' own credentials to access their data.\n\nHere are two examples to clarify:\n\n##### Example 1: Sync ACME app with HubSpot\n\nBob sets up n8n to collect a user's HubSpot credentials to sync data in the ACME app with data in HubSpot.\n\n<span style=\"color: #BF2F51;\">**NOT ALLOWED**</span> under the Sustainable Use License. This use case collects the user's own HubSpot credentials to pull information to feed into the ACME app.\n\n##### Example 2: Embed AI chatbot in ACME app\n\nBob sets up n8n to embed an AI chatbot within the ACME app. The AI chatbot's credentials in n8n use Bob's company credentials. ACME app end-users only enter their questions or queries to the chatbot.\n\n<span style=\"color: #1C9985;\">**ALLOWED**</span> under the Sustainable Use License. No user credentials are being collected."
