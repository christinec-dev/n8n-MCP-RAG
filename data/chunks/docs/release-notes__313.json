Manual workflow executions now use the same permissions checks as production executions, meaning you can't do a manual execution of a workflow if you don't have access to the credentials. Previously, owners and admins could do manual executions without credentials being shared with them. To resolve this, the credential creator needs to [share the credential](/credentials/credential-sharing.md) with you.\n///\n\n<div class=\"n8n-new-features\" markdown>\n\n#### New feature: Projects\n\nWith projects and roles, you can give your team access to collections of workflows and credentials, rather than having to share each workflow and credential individually. Simultaneously, you tighten security by limiting access to people on the relevant team.\n<br /><br />\nRefer to the [RBAC](/user-management/rbac/index.md) documentation for information on creating projects and using roles.\n<br /><br />\nThe number of projects and role types vary depending on your plan. Refer to [Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for details.\n\n<video src=\"/_video/release-notes/rbac-glimpse.mp4\" controls width=\"100%\"></video>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"n8n-new-features\" markdown>\n\n#### New node: Slack Trigger\n\nThis release adds a trigger node for Slack. Refer to the [Slack Trigger documentation](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger.md) for details.\n\n</div>"
