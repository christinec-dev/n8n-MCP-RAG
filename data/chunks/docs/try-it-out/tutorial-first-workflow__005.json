  "content": "## Step three: Add the NASA node and set up credentials\n\nThe [NASA node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.nasa.md) interacts with NASA's [public APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) to fetch useful data. We will use the real-time data from the API to find solar events.\n\n??? explanation \"Credentials\"\n    Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node. The type of information required varies depending on the app/service concerned. You should be careful about sharing or revealing the credentials outside of n8n.\n\n1. Select the **Add node** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> connector on the Schedule Trigger node.\n1. Search for **NASA**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n1. Select **NASA** to view a list of operations.\n1. Search for and select **Get a DONKI solar flare**. This operation returns a report about recent solar flares. When you select the operation, n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.\n1. To access the NASA APIs, you need to set up credentials:\n    1. Select the  **Credential for NASA API** dropdown.\n    1. Select **Create new credential**. n8n opens the credentials view.\n    1. Go to [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) and fill out the form from the **Generate API Key** link. The NASA site generates the key and emails it to the address you entered.\n    1. Check your email account for the API key. Copy the key, and paste it into **API Key** in n8n.\n    1. Select **Save**.\n    1. Close the credentials screen. n8n returns to the node. The new credentials should be automatically selected in **Credential for NASA API**.\n\n1. By default, DONKI Solar Flare provides data for the past 30 days. To limit it to just the last week, use **Additional Fields**:\n    1. Select **Add field**.\n    1. Select **Start date**.\n    1. To get a report starting from a week ago, you can use an expression: next to **Start date**, select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png){.off-glb}</span> to open the full expressions editor.\n    1. In the **Expression** field, enter the following expression:\n    ```js\n    {{ $today.minus(7, 'days') }}\n    ```\n    This generates a date in the correct format, seven days before the current date.\n\n    ![image showing the expression above generating a date](/_images/try-it-out/tutorial-date.png)\n\n    ??? explanation \"Date and time formats in n8n...\"\n        n8n uses Luxon to work with date and time, and also provides two variables for convenience: `$now` and `$today`. For more information, refer to [Expressions > Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon.md).\n\n1. Close the **Edit Expression** modal to return to the NASA node.\n1. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Execute step** to run the node manually. n8n calls the NASA API and displays details of solar flares in the past seven days in the **OUTPUT** section.\n1. Close the NASA node to return to the workflow canvas."
