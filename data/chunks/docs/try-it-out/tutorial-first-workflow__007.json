For this example, you'll send data to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/). Postbin is a service that receives data and displays it on a temporary web page.\n\n1. On the If node, select the **Add node** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> connector labeled **true**.\n1. Search for **PostBin**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n1. Select **PostBin**.\n1. Select **Send a request**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.\n1. Go to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/) and select **Create Bin**. Leave the tab open so you can come back to it when testing the workflow.\n1. Copy the bin ID. It looks similar to `1651063625300-2016451240051`.\n1. In n8n, paste your Postbin ID into **Bin ID**.\n1. Now, configure the data to send to Postbin. Next to **Bin Content**, select the **Expression** tab (you will need to mouse-over the **Bin Content** for the tab to appear), then select the expand button <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png){.off-glb}</span> to open the full expressions editor.\n1. You can now click and drag the correct field from the If Node output into the expressions editor to automatically create a reference for this label. In this case the input we want is 'classType'.\n1. Once dropped into the expressions editor it will transform into this reference: `{{$json[\"classType\"]}}`. Add a message to it, so that the full expression is:\n\n    ```js\n    There was a solar flare of class {{$json[\"classType\"]}}\n    ```\n\n    ![image showing the expression above generating output](/_images/try-it-out/tutorial-expression.png)\n\n1. Close the expressions editor to return to the node.\n1. Close the Postbin node to return to the canvas.\n1. Add another Postbin node, to handle the **false** output path from the If node:\n    1. Hover over the Postbin node, then select **Node context menu** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Node context menu icon](/_images/common-icons/node-context-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> > **Duplicate node** to duplicate the first Postbin node.\n    1. Drag the **false** connector from the If node to the left side of the new Postbin node."
