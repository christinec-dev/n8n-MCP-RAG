In this tutorial we will use the [If node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if.md) to create two branches that each generate a report from the NASA data. Solar flares have five possible classifications; we will add logic that sends a report with the lower classifications to one output, and the higher classifications to another.\n\nAdd the If node:\n\n1. Select the **Add node** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> connector on the NASA node.\n1. Search for **If**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n1. Select **If** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.\n1. You need to check the value of the `classType` property in the NASA data. To do this:\n\t1. Drag **classType** into **Value 1**.\n\n\t\t/// note | Make sure you ran the NASA node in the previous section\n\t\tIf you didn't follow the step in the previous section to run the NASA node, you won't see any data to work with in this step.\n\t\t///\n\n    1. Change the comparison operation to **String > Contains**.\n    1. In **Value 2**, enter **X**. This is the highest classification of solar flare. In the next step, you will create two reports: one for X class solar flares, and one for all the smaller solar flares.\n1. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Execute step** to run the node manually. n8n tests the data against the condition, and shows which results match true or false in the **OUTPUT** panel.\n\n    /// note | Weeks without large solar flares\n    In this tutorial, you are working with live data. If you find there aren't any X class solar flares when you run the workflow, try replacing **X** in **Value 2** with either **A**, **B**, **C**, or **M**.\n    ///\n\n1. Once you are happy the node will return some events, you can close the node to return to the canvas."
