Previously, n8n executed the first node of each branch, then the second of each branch, and so on (breadth-first). The new execution order ensures that each branch executes completely before starting the next one (depth-first). Branches execute based on their position on the canvas, from top to bottom. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost one executes first.\n\nn8n used to execute multi-input nodes as long as they received data on their first input. Nodes connected to the second input of multi-input nodes automatically executed regardless of whether they received data. The new execution order introduced in n8n 1.0 simplifies this behavior: Nodes are now executed only when they receive data, and multi-input nodes require data on at least one of their inputs to execute.\n\nYour existing workflows will use the legacy order, while new workflows will execute using the v1 order. You can configure the execution order for each workflow in [workflow settings](/workflows/settings.md).\n\n[PR #4238](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/4238), [PR #6246](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6246), [PR #6507](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6507)"
