Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.\n* **Execute Once**: The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items.\n* **Retry On Fail**: When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds. \n* **On Error**: \n    - **Stop Workflow**: Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution.\n    - **Continue**: Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data.\n    - **Continue (using error output)**: Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling.\n\nYou can document your workflow using node notes:\n\n* **Notes**: Note to save with the node.\n* **Display note in flow**: If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle."
