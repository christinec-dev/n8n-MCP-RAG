Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.\n\n/// note | Workflow history and execution history\nDon't confuse workflow history with the [Workflow-level executions list](/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions.md).\n\nExecutions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](/workflows/executions/debug.md) in your current workflow.\n\nWorkflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.\n///"
