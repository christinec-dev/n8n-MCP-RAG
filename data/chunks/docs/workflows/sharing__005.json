Editors are other users with access to the workflow.\n\nYou can't change the workflow owner, except when deleting the user.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nWorkflow sharing allows editors to use all [credentials](/glossary.md#credential-n8n) used in the workflow. This includes credentials that aren't explicitly shared with them using [credential sharing](/credentials/credential-sharing.md).\n///"
