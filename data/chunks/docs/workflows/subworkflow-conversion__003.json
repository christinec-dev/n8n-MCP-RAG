  "content": "## Selecting nodes for a sub-workflow\n\nTo convert part of a workflow to a sub-workflow, you must select the nodes in the original workflow that you want to convert.\n\nDo this by selecting a group of valid nodes. The selection must be continuous and must connect to the rest of the workflow from at most one start node and one end node. The selection must fulfill these conditions:\n\n- Must not include trigger nodes.\n- Only a single node in the selection can have incoming connections from nodes *outside* of the selection.\n\t- That node can have multiple incoming connections, but only a single input *branch* (which means it can't be a [Merge node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md) for example).\n\t- That node can't have incoming connections from other nodes in the selection.\n- Only a single node in the selection can have outgoing connections to nodes *outside* of the selection.\n\t- That node can have multiple outgoing connections, but only a single output branch (it can't be an [If node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if.md) for example).\n\t- That node can't have outgoing connections to other nodes in the selection.\n- The selection must include all nodes between the input and output nodes."
