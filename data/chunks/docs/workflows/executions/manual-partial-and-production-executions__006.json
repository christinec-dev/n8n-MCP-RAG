  "content": "## Production executions\n\nProduction executions occur when a triggering event or schedule automatically runs a workflow.\n\nTo configure production executions, you must attach a [trigger node](/glossary.md#trigger-node-n8n) (any trigger other than the [manual trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger.md) works) and switch workflow's toggle to **Active**. Once activated, the workflow automatically executes whenever the trigger condition occurs.\n\nThe execution flow for production executions doesn't display in the Editor tab of the workflow as with manual executions. Instead, you can see executions in the workflow's **Executions** tab according to your [workflow settings](/workflows/settings.md). From there, you can explore and troubleshoot problems using the [debug in editor feature](/workflows/executions/debug.md)."
