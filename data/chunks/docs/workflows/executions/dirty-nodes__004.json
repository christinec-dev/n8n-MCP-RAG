  "content": "## Why n8n marks nodes dirty\n\nThere are several reasons why n8n might flag execution data as stale. For example:\n\n- Inserting or deleting a node: labels the first node that follows the inserted node dirty.\n- Modifying node parameters: labels the modified node dirty.\n- Adding a connector: labels the destination node of the new connector dirty.\n- Deactivating a node: labels the first node that follows the deactivated node dirty.\n\n??? explanation \"Other reasons n8n marks nodes dirty\"\n    - Unpinning a node: labels the unpinned node dirty.\n    - Modifying pinned data: labels the node that comes after the pinned data dirty.\n    - If any of the above actions occur inside a loop, also labels the first node of the loop dirty.\n\n    For sub-nodes, also labels any executed parent nodes (up to and including the root) when:\n\n    - Editing an executed sub-node\n    - Adding a new sub-node\n    - Disconnecting or deleting a sub-node\n    - Deactivating a sub-node\n    - Activating a sub-node\n\n<div class=\"grid cards\" markdown>\n\n-   When deleting a connected node in a workflow:\n\n    ![\"Image of node displayed with yellow border\"](/_images/workflows/executions/dirty-before.png)\n\n-   The next node in the sequence becomes dirty:\n\n    ![\"Image of node displayed with yellow border\"](/_images/workflows/executions/dirty-after.png)\n\n</div>\n\nWhen using loops (with the [Loop over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches.md) node), when any node within the loop is dirty, the initial node of the loop is also considered dirty:\n\n![\"Image of node displayed with yellow border\"](/_images/workflows/executions/dirty-loop.png)"
