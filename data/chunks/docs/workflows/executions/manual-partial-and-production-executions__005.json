  "content": "### Troubleshooting partial executions\n\nSome common issues you might come across when running partial executions include the following:\n\n<!-- vale from-microsoft.Contractions = NO -->\n> The destination node is not connected to any trigger. Partial executions need a trigger.\n<!-- vale from-microsoft.Contractions = YES -->\n\nThis error message appears when you try to perform a partial execution without connecting the workflow to a trigger. Manual executions, including partial executions, attempt to mimic production executions when possible. Part of this includes requiring a trigger node to describe when the workflow logic should execute.\n\nTo work around this, connect a trigger node to the workflow with the node you're trying to execute. Most often, a [manual trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger.md) is the simplest option.\n\n> Please execute the whole workflow, rather than just the node. (Existing execution data is too large.)\n\nThis error can appear when performing partial executions on workflows with large numbers of branches. Partial executions involve sending data and workflow logic to the n8n backend in a way that isn't required for full executions. This error occurs when your workflow exceeds the maximum size allowed for these messages.\n\nTo work around this, consider using the [limit node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.limit.md) to limit node output while running partial executions. Once the workflow is running as intended, you can disable or delete the limit node before enabling production execution."
