  "content": "### Partial Execution for AI Tools\n\nWe’ve made it easier to build and iterate on AI agents in n8n. You can now run and test specific tools without having to execute the entire agent workflow.\n\nPartial execution is especially useful when refining or troubleshooting parts of your agent logic. It allows you to test changes incrementally, without triggering full agent runs, reducing unnecessary AI calls, token usage, and downstream activity. This makes iteration faster, more cost-efficient, and more precise when working with complex or multi-step AI workflows.\n\nPartial execution for AI tools is available now for all tools - making it even easier to build, test, and fine-tune AI agents in n8n.\n\n<br>\n<video src=\"/_video/release-notes/AI-agent-partial-execution.mp4\" controls width=\"100%\"></video>\n<br>\n\n**How to:**\n\nTo use this feature you can either:\n\n- Click the **Play** button on the tool you want to execute directly from the canvas view.\n- Open the tool’s **Node Details View** and select **\"Execute Step\"** to run it from there.\n\nIf you have previously run the workflow, the input and output will be prefilled with data from the last execution. A pop-up form will open where you can manually fill in the parameters before executing your test."
