  "content": "## Details\n\nSome other details about concurrency to keep in mind:\n\n- Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, or error executions.\n- [Test evaluations](/glossary.md#evaluation-n8n) do not count towards concurrency limits. Your test evaluation concurrency limit is equal to, but separate from, your plan's regular concurrency limit.\n- You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.\n- On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest."
