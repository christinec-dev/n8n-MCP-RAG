It's text-based.\n\nBinary data is non-textual data that n8n can't represent as plain text. This is files and media such as images, documents, audio files, and videos. It's much larger than textual data.\n\nIf a workflow consumes a large amounts of data and is past testing stage, it's a good option to stop saving the successful executions.\n\nThere are two ways you can control how much execution data n8n stores in the database:\n\nIn the admin dashboard:\n\n1. From your workspace or editor, navigate to **Admin Panel**.\n1. Select **Manage**.\n1. In **Executions to Save** deselect the executions you don't want to log.\n\nIn your workflow settings:\n\n1. Select the **Options** <span class=\"inline-image\">![Options menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> menu.\n1. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.\n1. Change **Save successful production executions** to **Do not save**."
