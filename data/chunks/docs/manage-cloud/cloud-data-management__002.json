  "content": "# Cloud data management\n\nThere are two concerns when managing data on Cloud:\n\n* Memory usage: complex workflows processing large amounts of data can exceed n8n's memory limits. If this happens, the instance can crash and become inaccessible.\n* Data storage: depending on your execution settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage. \n\nTo avoid these issues, n8n recommends that you build your workflows with memory efficiency in mind, and don't save unnecessary data"
