This change increases security.\n\nIf permission errors appear in your n8n container logs when starting n8n, you may need to update the permissions by executing the following command on the Docker host:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -it --user root -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n --entrypoint chown n8nio/base:16 -R node:node /home/node/.n8n\n```\n\n#### Image removal\n\nWe've removed the Debian and RHEL images. If you were using these you need to change the image you use. This shouldn't result in any errors unless you were making a custom image based on one of those images.\n\n#### Entrypoint change\n\nThe entrypoint for the container has changed and you no longer need to specify the n8n command. If you were previously running `n8n worker --concurrency=5` it's now `worker --concurrency=5`\n\n[PR #6365](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6365)"
