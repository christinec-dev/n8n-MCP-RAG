However, it becomes important if you want to:\n\n - Create your own node\n - Write custom [expressions](/glossary.md#expression-n8n)\n - Use the Function or Function Item node\n\nThis section covers: \n\n* [Data structure](/data/data-structure.md)\n* [Data flow within nodes](/data/data-flow-nodes.md)\n* [Transforming data](/data/transforming-data.md)\n* [Process data using code](/data/code.md)\n* [Pinning](/data/data-pinning.md) and [editing](/data/data-editing.md) data during workflow development.\n* [Data mapping](/data/data-mapping/index.md) and [Item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/index.md): how data items link to each other."
