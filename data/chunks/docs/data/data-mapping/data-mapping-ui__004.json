For example, given the following data:\n\n```js\n[\n\t{\n\t\t\"fruit\": \"apples\",\n\t\t\"color\": \"green\"\n\t}\n]\n```\n\nYou can map `fruit` by dragging and dropping **fruit** from the **INPUT** into the field where you want to use its value. This creates an expression, `{{ $json.fruit }}`. When the node iterates over input items, the value of the field becomes the value of `fruit` for each item."
