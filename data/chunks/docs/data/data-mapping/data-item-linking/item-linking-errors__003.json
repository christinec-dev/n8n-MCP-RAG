  "content": "### Fix for 'Info for expressions missing from previous node'\n\nIf you see this error message:\n\n> ERROR: Info for expression missing from previous node\n\nThere's a node in the chain that doesn't return pairing information. The solution here depends on the type of the previous node:\n\n- Code nodes: make sure you return which input items the node used to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking in the code node](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node.md) for more information.\n- Custom or community nodes: the node creator needs to update the node to return which input items it uses to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking for node creators](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building.md) for more information."
