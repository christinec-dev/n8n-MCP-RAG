This can be done using the Editor UI or API call.\n\n\n#### Using the Editor UI\n\n1. From the menu select **Credentials** > **New**.\n1. Use the drop-down to select the **Credential type** to create, for example *Airtable*.\n    ![Create New Credentials drop-down](/_images/embed/managing-workflows/create_new_credentials.png)\n1. In the **Create New Credentials** modal, enter the corresponding credentials details for the user, and select the nodes that will have access to these credentials.\n    ![Create New Credentials modal](/_images/embed/managing-workflows/create_new_credentials2.png)\n1. Click **Create** to finish and save.\n\n#### Using the API\n\nThe frontend API used by the Editor UI can also be called to achieve the same result. The API endpoint is in the format: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials`.\n\nFor example, to create the credentials in the Editor UI example above, the request would be:\n```\nPOST https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials\n```\n\nWith the request body:\n```json\n{\n   \"name\":\"MyAirtable\",\n   \"type\":\"airtableApi\",\n   \"nodesAccess\":[\n      {\n         \"nodeType\":\"n8n-nodes-base.airtable\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"data\":{\n      \"apiKey\":\"q12we34r5t67yu\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThe response will contain the ID of the new credentials, which you will use when creating the workflow for this user:\n```json\n{\n   \"data\":{\n      \"name\":\"MyAirtable\",\n      \"type\":\"airtableApi\",\n      \"data\":{\n         \"apiKey\":\"q12we34r5t67yu\"\n      },\n      \"nodesAccess\":[\n         {\n            \"nodeType\":\"n8n-nodes-base.airtable\",\n            \"date\":\"2021-09-10T07:41:27.770Z\"\n         }\n      ],\n      \"id\":\"29\",\n      \"createdAt\":\"2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z\",\n      \"updatedAt\":\"2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z\"\n   }\n}\n```"
