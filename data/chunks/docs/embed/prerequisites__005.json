If not, all data is lost.\n* If using Postgres, don't use the `tablePrefix` configuration option. It will be deprecated in the near future.\n* Pay attention to the changelog of new versions and consider reverting migrations before downgrading.\n* Set up at least the basic database security and stability mechanisms such as IP allow lists and backups."
