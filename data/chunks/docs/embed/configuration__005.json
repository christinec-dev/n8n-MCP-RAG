Here are the most relevant environment variables for your hosted solution:\n\n| Variable | Type | Default | Description |\n| :------- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |\n| `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` | Number | `-1` | Sets a default timeout (in seconds) to all workflows after which n8n stops their execution. Users can override this for individual workflows up to the duration set in `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX`. Set `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` to `-1` to disable. |\n| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` | Boolean | `true` | Whether to delete data of past executions on a rolling basis. |\n| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` | Number | `336` | The execution age (in hours) before it's deleted. |\n| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` | Number | `10000` | Maximum number of executions to keep in the database. 0 = no limit |\n| `NODES_EXCLUDE` | Array of strings | - | Specify which nodes not to load. For example, to block nodes that can be a security risk if users aren't trustworthy: `NODES_EXCLUDE: \"[\\\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\\\", \\\"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\\\"]\"` |\n| `NODES_INCLUDE` | Array of strings | - | Specify which nodes to load. |\n| `N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED` | Boolean | `true` | Enable [workflow templates](/glossary.md#template-n8n) (true) or disable (false). |\n| `N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST` | String | `https://api.n8n.io` | Change this if creating your own workflow template library. Note that to use your own workflow templates library, your API must provide the same endpoints and response structure as n8n's. Refer to [Workflow templates](/workflows/templates.md) for more information. |"
