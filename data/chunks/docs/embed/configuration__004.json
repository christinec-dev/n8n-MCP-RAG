This credential data isn't visible to users but the backend uses it automatically.\n\nIn the Editor UI, n8n hides all overwritten fields by default. This means that users are able to authenticate using  OAuth by pressing the \"connect\" button on the credentials.\n\nn8n offers two ways to apply credential overwrites: using Environment Variable and using the REST API.\n\n#### Using environment variables\n\nYou can set credential overwrites using environment variable by setting the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA` to `{ CREDENTIAL_NAME: { PARAMETER: VALUE }}`.\n\n/// warning\nEven though this is possible, it isn't recommended. Environment variables aren't protected in n8n, so the data can leak to users.\n///\n\n#### Using REST APIs\n\nThe recommended way is to load the data using a custom REST endpoint. Set the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT` to a path under which this endpoint should be made available.\n\n/// note\nThe endpoints can be called just one at a time for security reasons.\n///\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Activate the endpoint by setting the environment variable in the environment n8n runs under:\n\n    ```sh\n    export CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT=send-credentials\n    ```\n\n2. A JSON file with the credentials to overwrite is then needed. For example, a `oauth-credentials.json` file to overwrite credentials for Asana and GitHub could look like this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"asanaOAuth2Api\": {\n            \"clientId\": \"<id>\",\n            \"clientSecret\": \"<secret>\"\n        },\n        \"githubOAuth2Api\": {\n            \"clientId\": \"<id>\",\n            \"clientSecret\": \"<secret>\"\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. Then apply it to the instance by sending it using curl:\n\n    ```sh\n    curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data @oauth-credentials.json http://localhost:5678/send-credentials\n    ```\n\n/// note\nThere are cases when credentials are based on others. For example, the `googleSheetsOAuth2Api` extends the `googleOAuth2Api`.\nIn this case, you can set parameters on the parent credentials (`googleOAuth2Api`) for all child-credentials (`googleSheetsOAuth2Api`) to use.\n///"
