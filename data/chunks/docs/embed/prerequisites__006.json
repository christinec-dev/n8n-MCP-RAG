It's the nature of your workflows and the data being processed that determines your memory requirements.\n\nFor example, while most nodes just pass data to the next node in the workflow, the [Code node](/code/code-node.md) creates a pre-processing and post-processing copy of the data. When dealing will large binary files, this can consume all available resources."
