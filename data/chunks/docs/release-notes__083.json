While sometimes necessary, this level of access can be excessive and too powerful for most use cases.  Scoped API keys allow you to limit access to only the resources and actions a service or user actually needs.\n\n**What’s new**\n\nWhen creating a new API key, you can now:\n\n- Select whether the key has read, write, or both types of access.  \n- Specify which resources the key can interact with.  \n\nSupported scopes include:\n\n- Variables — list, create, delete  \n- Security audit — generate reports  \n- Projects — list, create, update, delete  \n- Executions — list, read, delete  \n- Credentials — list, create, update, delete, move  \n- Workflows — list, create, update, delete, move, add/remove tags  \n\nScoped API keys give you more control and security. You can limit access to only what’s needed, making it safer to work with third parties and easier to manage internal API usage."
