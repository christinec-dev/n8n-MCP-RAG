To process each item individually, set **Batch Size** to `1`.\n\nYou can batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you want to process a specific group of returned items.\n\nThe Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow so it's not necessary to add an IF node to stop the loop."
