This can be useful if you want to generate a single dataset from the data generated by multiple nodes.\n\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n![Merging data from two previous nodes. The diagram shows three nodes lined up sequentially. The first node is labeled Fetch data, the second is labeled Modify data, and the third is labeled Merge: append both data sets.
