It can also help if your workflow grows large enough to encounter [memory issues](/hosting/scaling/memory-errors.md). Creating sub-workflows uses the [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow.md) and [Execute Sub-workflow Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger.md) nodes.\n\nSub-wokflow executions don't count towards your plan's monthly execution or active workflow limits."
