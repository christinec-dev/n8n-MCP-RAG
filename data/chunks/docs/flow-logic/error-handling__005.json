Usually, this is due to things like errors in node settings, or the workflow running out of memory.\n\nYou can add the [Stop And Error](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror.md) node to your workflow to force executions to fail under your chosen circumstances, and trigger the error workflow."
