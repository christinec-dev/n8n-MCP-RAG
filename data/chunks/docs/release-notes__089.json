It's designed to give admins (and owners) better visibility of their most important workflow metrics and help troubleshoot potential issues and improvements. <br> \n<br>\n\nIn this first release, we’re introducing a summary banner, the insights dashboard, and time saved per execution. <br> <br>\n\n#### 1. Summary banner\nA new banner on the overview page that gives instance admins and owners a birds eye view of key metrics over the last 7 days.\n\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n    ![Summary banner](/_images/release-notes/Insights-summary-banner.png)\n    <figcaption>Insights summary banner</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAvailable metrics:\n\n- Total production executions\n- Total failed executions\n- Failure rate\n- Average runtime of all workflows\n- Estimated time saved\n\nThis overview is designed to help you stay on top of workflow activity at a glance. It is available for all plans and editions. <br> <br>\n\n#### 2. Insights dashboard\nOn Pro and Enterprise plans, a new dashboard offers a deeper view into workflow performance and activity. \n\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n    ![Insights dashboard](/_images/release-notes/Insights-dashboard.png)\n    <figcaption>Insights dashboard</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe dashboard includes:\n\n- Total production executions over time, including a comparison of successful and failed executions\n- Per-workflow breakdowns of key metrics\n- Comparisons with previous periods to help spot changes in usage or behavior\n- Runtime average and failure rate over time\n\n#### 3. Time saved per execution\nWithin workflow settings, you can now assign a “time saved per execution” value to any workflow. This makes it possible to track the impact of your workflows and make it easier to share this visually with other teams and stakeholders.<br><br>\n\nThis is just the beginning for Insights: the next phase will introduce more advanced filtering and comparisons, custom date ranges, and additional monitoring capabilities. \n\n</div>"
