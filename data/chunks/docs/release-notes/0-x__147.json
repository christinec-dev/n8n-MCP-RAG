Any field with the hint **Enter the field name as text** should now support mapping a data key using drag and drop. Node builders can enable this in their own nodes. Refer to [Creating nodes | UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md#support-drag-and-drop-for-data-keys) for more information.\n* Editor: add the [HTML editor component](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md#html) for use in parameters. This means node builders can now use the HTML editor that n8n uses in the HTML node as a UI component.\n* Editor: append expressions in fixed values when mapping to string and JSON inputs.\n* Editor: continue to show mapping tooltip after dismiss.\n* Editor: roll out schema view."
