Equivalent to DateTime.now().\n* `$today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).\n\n#### Negative operations in If and Switch nodes\n\nMade it easier to perform negative operations on strings.\n\nThis release adds one new operation for numbers:\n\n* Is Not Empty\n\nAnd the following new operations for strings:\n\n* Not Ends With\n* Regex Not Match\n* Not Starts With\n* Is Not Empty\n\nAdditionally, Regex is now labelled Regex Match.\n\n#### New node: Redis Trigger\n\nAdded a Redis Trigger node, so you can now start workflows based on a Redis event.\n\n* [Redis Trigger:](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.redistrigger.md) Added a Redis Trigger node."
