  "content": "### New features\n\n* Add new event hooks to support telemetry around the new onboarding experience.\n* Update nodes to set required path type.\n* Core: add configurable execution history limit. Use this to improve performance when self-hosting. Refer to [Execution Data | Enable data pruning ](/hosting/scaling/execution-data.md#enable-data-pruning) for more information.\n* Core: add execution runData recovery and status field. This allows us to show execution statuses on the **Executions** list.\n* Core: add SAML feature flag. This is preparatory for an upcoming feature.\n* Editor: improvements to the nodes panel search. When searching in root view, n8n now displays results from both trigger and regular nodes. When searching in a category view, n8n shows results from the category, and also suggests results from other categories.\n* Hide sensitive value in authentication header credentials and authentication query credentials.\n* Support feature flag evaluation server side.\n* Deprecate the Read Binary File node. Use the [Read Binary Files](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile.md) node instead."
