You can't copy work directly between environments in n8n. \n\nA common pattern is:\n\n1. Do work in your developments instance.\n1. Push the work to the development branch in Git.\n1. Merge your development branch into your production branch.\tRefer to the documentation for your Git provider for guidance on doing this:  \n\t* [GitHub: Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)\n\t* [GitLab: Creating merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)\n\t* [Git: Basic branching and merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)\n1. In your production n8n instance, pull the changes. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n)."
