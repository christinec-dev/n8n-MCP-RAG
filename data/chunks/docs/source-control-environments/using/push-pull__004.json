If the original owner isn't on the new instance, n8n sets the user performing the pull as the workflow owner.\n\nIf the original owner is a [project](/user-management/rbac/index.md):\n\nn8n tries to match the original project name to a project name on the new instance. If no matching project exists, n8n creates a new project with the name, assigns the current user as project owner, and imports the workflows and credentials to the project."
