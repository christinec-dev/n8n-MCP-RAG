The full setup in this case is likely to be a [Multiple instances, multiple branches](#multiple-instances-multiple-branches) pattern, but with one instance switching between branches.\n\nThis is useful to review work. For example, different users could work on their own instance and push to their own branch. The reviewer could work in a review instance, and switch between branches to load work from different users.\n\n/// note | No cleanup\nn8n doesn't clean up the existing contents of an instance when changing branches. Switching branches in this pattern results in all the workflows from each branch being in your instance.\n///\n![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-one-multi.png)"
