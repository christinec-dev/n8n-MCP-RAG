  "content": "## Push, pull, and commit\n\nn8n uses three key Git processes:\n\n* **Push**: send work from your instance to Git. This saves a copy of your workflows and tags, as well as credential and variable stubs, to Git. You can choose which workflows you want to save.\n* **Pull**: get the workflows, tags, and variables from Git and load it into n8n. You will need to populate any credentials or variable stubs included in the refreshed items.\n\n    /// warning | Pulling overwrites your work\n    If you have made changes to a workflow in n8n, you must push the changes to Git before pulling. When you pull, it overwrites any changes you've made if they aren't stored in Git.\n    ///\n\t\t\n* **Commit**: a commit in n8n is a single occurrence of pushing work to Git. In n8n, commit and push happen at the same time.\n\nRefer to [Push and pull](/source-control-environments/using/push-pull.md) for detailed information about how n8n interacts with Git."
