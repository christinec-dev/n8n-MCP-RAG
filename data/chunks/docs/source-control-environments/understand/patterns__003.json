For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them to their own branches. Push work from your development instance to its branch, do a pull request to move work to the production branch, then pull to the production instance.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/source-control-environments/multi-instance-multi-branch-pros-cons.md\"\n\n![Diagram](/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)"
