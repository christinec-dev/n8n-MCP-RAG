For a more detailed introduction to environments in software development, refer to [Codecademy | Environments](https://www.codecademy.com/article/environments).\n\nLow-code development in n8n is similar. n8n is where you build and run your workflows. Your instance may have particular configurations: on Cloud, n8n determines the configuration. On self-hosted instances, there are extensive [configuration options](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods.md). You may also have made changes to the settings of your instance. This combination of n8n and your instance's specific configuration and settings is the environment your workflows run in.\n\nThere are advantages to having more than one environment. A common pattern is to have different environments for development and production:\n\n* Development: do work and make changes.\n* Production: the live environment.\n\nA setup like this helps you make changes to workflows without breaking workflows that are in use."
