You'll create two environments: development and production. It uses GitHub as the Git provider. The process is similar for other providers. \n\nn8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. You link an n8n instance to a Git branch, and use a push-pull pattern to move work between environments. You should have some understanding of environments and Git. If you need more information on these topics, refer to:\n\n* [Environments in n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/environments.md): the purpose of environments, and how they work in n8n. \n* [Git and n8n](/source-control-environments/understand/git.md): Git concepts and source control in n8n."
