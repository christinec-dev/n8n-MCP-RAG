It consists of two sections:\n\n* `setup` > `addons` defines the Heroku addons to use. In this case, the PostgreSQL database addon.\n* The `build` section defines how Heroku builds the application. In this case it uses the Docker buildpack to build a `web` service based on the supplied `Dockerfile`."
