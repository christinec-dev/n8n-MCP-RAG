Select the project to host the server, or create a new project by selecting **+ NEW PROJECT**.\n3. Select **+ CREATE SERVER** on the project tile you want to add it to.\n\nYou can change most of the settings to suit your needs, but as this guide uses Docker to run the application, under the **Image** section, select \"Docker CE\" from the **APPS** tab.\n\n/// note | Type\nWhen creating the server, Hetzner asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, the CPX11 type is enough.\n///\n/// note | SSH keys\nHetzner lets you choose between SSH and password-based authentication. SSH is more secure. The rest of this guide assumes you are using SSH.\n///"
