You must change the following values:\n\n- **N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY**, which n8n uses to [encrypt user account details](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment.md) before saving to the database.\n- **WEBHOOK_URL** should match the application name you create to ensure that webhooks have the correct URL."
