Running Postgres on GCP requires a specific Kubernetes Storage Class. You can read [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/deploying-highly-available-postgresql-with-gke) for specifics, but the `storage.yaml` manifest creates it for you. You may want to change the regions to create the storage in under the `allowedTopologies` > `matchedLabelExpressions` > `values` key. By default, they're set to `us-central`.\n\n```yaml\nâ€¦\nallowedTopologies:\n  - matchLabelExpressions:\n      - key: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone\n        values:\n          - us-central1-b\n          - us-central1-c\n```"
