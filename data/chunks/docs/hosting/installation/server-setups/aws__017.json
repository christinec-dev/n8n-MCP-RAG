Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to a static address of the instance.\n\nTo find the address of the n8n service running on the instance:\n\n1. Open the **Clusters** section of the **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service** page in the AWS console.\n2. Select the name of the cluster to open its configuration page.\n3. Select the **Resources** tab, then **Service and networking** > **Services**.\n4. Select the **n8n** service and copy the **Load balancer URLs** value. Use this value suffixed with the n8n service port (5678) for DNS.\n\n/// note | Use HTTP\nThis guide uses HTTP connections for the services it defines, for example in `n8n-deployment.yaml`. However, if you click the **Load balancer URLs** value, EKS takes you to an \"HTTPS\" URL which results in an error. To solve this, when you open the n8n subdomain, make sure to use HTTP.\n///"
