This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.\n\nThe `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.\n\n```yaml\n…\nvolumes:\n  - name: n8n-claim0\n    persistentVolumeClaim:\n      claimName: n8n-claim0\n…\n```"
