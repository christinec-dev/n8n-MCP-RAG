Depending on how you choose to install n8n, there are differences in how to run the commands:\n\n* npm: the `n8n` command is directly available. The documentation uses this in the examples below.\n* Docker: the `n8n` command is available within your Docker container:\n\n    ```sh\n    docker exec -u node -it <n8n-container-name> <n8n-cli-command>\n    ```"
