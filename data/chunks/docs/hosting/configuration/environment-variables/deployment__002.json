Notably, for proxy variables, lowercase versions (like `http_proxy`) have precedence over uppercase variants (for example `HTTP_PROXY`) when both are present.\n\nTo learn more about proxy environment variables, check the [environment variables section of the package details](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-from-env#environment-variables).\n///\n<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->\n\n| Variable | Type  | Default  | Description |\n| :------- | :---- | :------- | :---------- |\n| `HTTP_PROXY` | String | - | A URL to proxy unencrypted HTTP requests through. When set, n8n proxies all unencrypted HTTP traffic from nodes through the proxy URL. |\n| `HTTPS_PROXY` | String | - | A URL to proxy TLS/SSL encrypted HTTP requests through. When set, n8n proxies all TLS/SSL encrypted HTTP traffic from nodes through the proxy URL. |\n| `ALL_PROXY` | String | - | A URL to proxy both unencrypted and encrypted HTTP requests through. When set, n8n uses this value when more specific variables (`HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY`) aren't present. |\n| `NO_PROXY` | String | - | A comma-separated list of hostnames or URLs that should bypass the proxy. When using `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, or `ALL_PROXY`, n8n will connect directly to the URLs or hostnames defined here instead of using the proxy. |\n| `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL` | String | - | Public URL where users can access the editor. Also used for emails sent from n8n and the redirect URL for SAML based authentication. |\n| `N8N_CONFIG_FILES` | String | - | Use to provide the path to any JSON [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods.md). |\n| `N8N_DISABLE_UI` | Boolean | `false` | Set to `true` to disable the UI. |\n| `N8N_PREVIEW_MODE` | Boolean | `false` | Set to `true` to run in preview mode. |\n| `N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED` | Boolean | `false` | Enables [workflow templates](/glossary.md#template-n8n) (true) or disable (false). |\n| `N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST` | String | `https://api.n8n.io` | Change this if creating your own workflow template library. Note that to use your own workflow templates library, your API must provide the same endpoints and response structure as n8n's. Refer to [Workflow templates](/workflows/templates.md) for more information. |\n| `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | String | Random key generated by n8n | Provide a custom key used to encrypt credentials in the n8n database. By default n8n generates a random key on first launch. |\n| `N8N_USER_FOLDER` | String | `user-folder` | Provide the path where n8n will create the `.n8n` folder. This directory stores user-specific data, such as database file and encryption key. |\n| `N8N_PATH` | String | `/` | The path n8n deploys to. |\n| `N8N_HOST` | String | `localhost` | Host name n"
