You can do this either through the UI or by setting environment variables. For more information, see [license key](/license-key.md).\n\n| Variable | Type  | Default  | Description |\n| :------- | :---- | :------- | :---------- |\n| `N8N_HIDE_USAGE_PAGE` | boolean | `false` | Hide the usage and plans page in the app. |\n| `N8N_LICENSE_ACTIVATION_KEY` | String | `''` | Activation key to initialize license. Not applicable if the n8n instance was already activated. |\n| `N8N_LICENSE_AUTO_RENEW_ENABLED` | Boolean | `true` | Enables (true) or disables (false) autorenewal for licenses. <br>If disabled, you need to manually renew the license every 10 days by navigating to **Settings** > **Usage and plan**, and pressing `F5`. Failure to renew the license will disable all licensed features. |\n| `N8N_LICENSE_DETACH_FLOATING_ON_SHUTDOWN` | Boolean | `true` | Controls whether the instance releases [floating entitlements](/glossary.md#entitlement-n8n) back to the pool upon shutdown. Set to `true` to allow other instances to reuse the entitlements, or `false` to retain them. <br> For production instances that must always keep their licensed features, set this to `false`. |\n| `N8N_LICENSE_SERVER_URL` | String | `https://license.n8n.io/v1` | Server URL to retrieve license. |\n| `N8N_LICENSE_TENANT_ID` | Number | `1` | Tenant ID associated with the license.
