It's possible to lift that restriction for built-in and external modules by setting the following environment variables:\n\n- `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN`: For built-in modules\n- `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL`: For external modules sourced from n8n/node_modules directory. External module support is disabled when an environment variable isn't set.\n\n```bash"
