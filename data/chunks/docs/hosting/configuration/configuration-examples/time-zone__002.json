To set a different default timezone, set `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` to the appropriate value. For example, if you want to set the timezone to Berlin (Germany):\n\n```bash\nexport GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin\n```\n\nYou can find the name of your timezone [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).\n\nRefer to [Environment variables reference](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization.md) for more information on this variable."
