You can't use it with the default n8n Docker image where the default setting for this variable is `/`, meaning that it uses the root-domain.\n///\n\nYou can configure the Base URL that the front end uses to connect to the back end's REST API. This is relevant when you want to host n8n's front end and back end separately. \n\n```bash\nexport VUE_APP_URL_BASE_API=https://n8n.example.com/\n```\nRefer to [Environment variables reference](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment.md) for more information on this variable."
