If the key isn't yet in the settings file,\nyou can set it using an environment variable, so that n8n \nuses your custom key instead of generating a new one.\n\nIn [queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode.md), you must specify the encryption key environment variable for all workers.\n\n```bash\nexport N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<SOME RANDOM STRING>\n```\nRefer to [Environment variables reference](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment.md) for more information on this variable."
