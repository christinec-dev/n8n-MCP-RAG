That's because n8n runs internally on port 5678 but the reverse proxy exposes it to the web on port 443. In that case, it's important to set the webhook URL manually so that n8n can display it in the Editor UI and register the correct webhook URLs with external services.\n\n```bash\nexport WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.example.com/\n```\nRefer to [Environment variables reference](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints.md) for more information on this variable."
