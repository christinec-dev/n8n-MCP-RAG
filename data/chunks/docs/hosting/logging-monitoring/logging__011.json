  "content": "### Implementation details\n\nn8n uses the `LoggerProxy` class, located in the `workflow` package. Calling the `LoggerProxy.init()` by passing in an instance of `Logger`, initializes the class before the usage.\n\nThe initialization process happens only once. The [`start.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts) file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the `LoggerProxy` class.\n\nOnce the `Logger` implementation gets created in the `cli` package, it can be obtained by calling the `getInstance` convenience method from the exported module.\n\nCheck the [start.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts) file to learn more about how this process works."
