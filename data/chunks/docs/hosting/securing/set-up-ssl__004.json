To do so, set the `N8N_SSL_CERT` and `N8N_SSL_KEY` environment variables to point to your generated certificate and key file.\n\nYou'll need to make sure the certificate stays renewed and up to date.\n\nRefer to [Deployment environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment.md) for more information on these variables and [Configuration](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods.md) for more information on setting environment variables."
