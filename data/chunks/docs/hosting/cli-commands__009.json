If you have workflows and credentials with the same IDs in your existing database, they will be overwritten. To avoid this, delete or change the IDs before importing.\n///\n\nAvailable flags:\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| --help | Help prompt. |\n| --input | Input file name or directory if you use --separate. |\n| --projectId | Import the workflow or credential to the specified project. Can't be used with `--userId`. |\n| --separate | Imports `*.json` files from directory provided by --input. |\n| --userId | Import the workflow or credential to the specified user. Can't be used with `--projectId`. |\n\n/// note | Migrating to SQLite\nn8n limits workflow and credential names to 128 characters, but SQLite doesn't enforce size limits.\n\nThis might result in errors like **Data too long for column name** during the import process.\n\nIn this case, you can edit the names from the n8n interface and export again, or edit the JSON file directly before importing.\n///"
