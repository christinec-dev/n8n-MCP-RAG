Running n8n with execution mode set to `queue` with an SQLite database isn't recommended.\n///\n\nSet the environment variable `EXECUTIONS_MODE` to `queue` on the main instance and any workers using the following command.\n\n```bash\nexport EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set `executions.mode` to `queue` in the [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/index.md)."
