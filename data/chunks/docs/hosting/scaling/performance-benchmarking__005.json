It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.\n\nSetup:\n\n- Hardware: ECS c5a.large instance (4GB RAM)\n- n8n setup: Single n8n instance (running in main mode, with Postgres database)\n- Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node\n\n<figure markdown>\n  ![Graph showing n8n response times by requests per second](/_images/hosting/scaling/benchmarking-single-instance-100-250.png)\n  <figcaption>This graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load. Under higher loads n8n usually still processes the data, but takes over 100s to respond.</figcaption>\n</figure>"
