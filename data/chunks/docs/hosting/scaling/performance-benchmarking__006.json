It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.\n\nSetup:\n\n- Hardware: seven ECS c5a.4xlarge instances (8GB RAM each)\n- n8n setup: two webhook instances, four worker instances, one database instance (MySQL), one main instance running n8n and Redis\n- Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node\n- Multi-instance setups use [Queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode.md)\n\n<figure markdown>\n  ![Graph showing n8n response times by requests per second](/_images/hosting/scaling/benchmarking-multi-instance-500-2500.png)\n  <figcaption>This graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load. Under higher loads n8n usually still processes the data, but takes over 100s to respond.</figcaption>\n</figure>"
