Follow the [configure the workers](#configuring-workers) section above to setup webhook processor nodes.\n///\n\nWebhook processors are another layer of scaling in n8n. Configuring the webhook processor is optional, and allows you to scale the incoming webhook requests.\n\nThis method allows n8n to process a huge number of parallel requests. All you have to do is add more webhook processes and workers accordingly. The webhook process will listen to requests on the same port (default: `5678`). Run these processes in containers or separate machines, and have a load balancing system to route requests accordingly.\n\nn8n doesn't recommend adding the main process to the load balancer pool. If you add the main process to the pool, it will receive requests and possibly a heavy load. This will result in degraded performance for editing, viewing, and interacting with the n8n UI.\n\nYou can start the webhook processor by executing the following command from the root directory:\n\n```\n./packages/cli/bin/n8n webhook\n```\n\nIf you're using Docker, use the following command:\n\n```\ndocker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 -e \"EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue\" docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n webhook\n```"
