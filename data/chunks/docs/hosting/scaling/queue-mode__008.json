If you want to host workers on a separate machine, install n8n on the machine and make sure that it's connected to your Redis instance and the n8n database.\n\nStart worker processes by running the following command from the root directory:\n\n```\n./packages/cli/bin/n8n worker\n```\n\nIf you're using Docker, use the following command:\n\n```\ndocker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n worker\n```\n\nYou can set up multiple worker processes. Make sure that all the worker processes have access to Redis and the n8n database.\n\n#### Worker server\n\nEach worker process runs a server that exposes optional endpoints:\n\n- `/healthz`: returns whether the worker is up, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable\n- `/healthz/readiness`: returns whether worker's DB and Redis connections are ready, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable\n- [credentials overwrite endpoint](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#credential-overwrites)\n- [`/metrics`](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/)\n\n#### View running workers \n\n/// info | Feature availability\n* Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.\n* If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).\n///\n\nYou can view running workers and their performance metrics in n8n by selecting **Settings** > **Workers**."
