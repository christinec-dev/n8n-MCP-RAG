You can use other S3-compatible services like Cloudflare R2 and Backblaze B2, but n8n doesn't officially support these.\n\n/// info | Enterprise-tier feature\nYou will need an [Enterprise license key](/license-key.md) for external storage. If your license key expires and you remain on S3 mode, the instance will be able to read from, but not write to, the S3 bucket.\n///"
