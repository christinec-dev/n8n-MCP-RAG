If you are using the same domain name for your n8n instance and the webhooks, you can set up your load balancer to route requests as follows:\n\n- Redirect any request that matches `/webhook/*` to the webhook servers pool\n- All other paths (the n8n internal API, the static files for the editor, etc.) should get routed to the main process\n\n**Note:** The default URL for manual workflow executions is `/webhook-test/*`. Make sure that these URLs route to your main process.\n\nYou can change this path in the configuration file `endpoints.webhook` or using the `N8N_ENDPOINT_WEBHOOK` environment variable. If you change these, update your load balancer accordingly."
