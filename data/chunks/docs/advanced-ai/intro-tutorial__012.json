From the log you can see this is set to \"You are a helpful assistant\". We can however change this prompt to alter the behavior of the chat model.\n\n1. Open the **AI Agent** node. In the bottom of the panel is a section labeled 'Options' and a selector labeled 'Add Option'. Use this to select 'System message'\n\n1. The system message is now displayed. This is the same priming prompt we noticed before in the logs. Change the prompt to something else to prime the chat model in a different way. You could try something like \"You are a brilliant poet who always replies in rhyming couplets\" for example.\n\n1. Close the node and return to the chat window. Repeat your message and notice how the output has changed.\n   ![image showing changed text for chat, now it rhymes; if you can believe that](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-intro-poet.png)"
