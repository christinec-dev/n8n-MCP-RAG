Wire the dataset up to your workflow\n\n#### Insert an evaluation trigger to pull in your dataset\n\nEach time the [evaluation trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluationtrigger.md) runs, it will output a single item representing one row of your dataset.\n\nClicking the 'Evaluate all' button to the left of the evaluation trigger will run your workflow multiple times in sequence, once for each row in your dataset. This is a special behavior of the evaluation trigger.\n\nWhile wiring the trigger up, you often only want to run it once. You can do this by either:\n\n- Setting the trigger's 'Max rows to process' to 1\n- Clicking on the 'Execute node' button on the trigger (rather than the 'Evaluate all' button)\n\n#### Wire the trigger up to your workflow\n\nYou can now connect the evaluation trigger to the rest of your workflow and reference the data that it outputs. At a minimum, you need to use the datasetâ€™s input column(s) later in the workflow.\n\nIf you have multiple triggers in your workflow you will need to [merge their branches together](/advanced-ai/evaluations/tips-and-common-issues.md#combining-multiple-triggers).\n\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n![Connecting the evaluation trigger](/_images/advanced-ai/evaluations/connecting-evaluation-trigger.png)\n<figcaption>The support ticket classification workflow with the evaluation trigger added in and wired up.</figcaption>\n</figure>"
