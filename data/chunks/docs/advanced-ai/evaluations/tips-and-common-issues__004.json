  "content": "## Avoiding evaluation breaking the chat\n\nn8n's internal chat reads the output data of the last executed node in the workflow. After adding an evaluation node with the ['set outputs' operation](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluation.md#set-outputs), this data may not be in the expected format, or even contain the chat response.\n\n![Add second output branch](/_images/advanced-ai/evaluations/add-second-output-branch.png)\n\nThe solution is to add an extra branch coming out of your agent. [Lower branches execute later](/flow-logic/execution-order.md) in n8n, which means any node you attach to this branch will execute last. You can use a no-op node here since it only needs to pass the agent output through."
