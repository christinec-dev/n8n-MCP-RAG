Instead of relying solely on the model's internal training data, RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to [ground](/glossary.md#ai-groundedness) responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge. RAG workflows typically rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently."
