This is a basic introduction to AI concepts and how they can be used in n8n workflows.\n\nAn [AI agent](/glossary.md#ai-agent) builds on [Large Language Models (LLMs)](/glossary.md#large-language-model-llm), which generate text based\non input by predicting the next word. While LLMs only process input to produce\noutput, AI agents add goal-oriented functionality. They can use [tools](/glossary.md#ai-tool), process\ntheir outputs, and make decisions to complete tasks and solve problems.\n\nIn n8n, the AI agent is represented as a node with some extra connections. \n\n| Feature             | LLM                        | AI Agent                           |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Core Capability     | Text generation            | Goal-oriented task completion      |\n| Decision-Making     | None                       | Yes                                |\n| Uses Tools/APIs     | No                         | Yes                                |\n| Workflow Complexity | Single-step                | Multi-step                         |\n| Scope               | Generates language         | Performs complex, real-world tasks |\n| Example             | LLM generating a paragraph | An agent scheduling an appointment |\n\nBy incorporating the AI agent as a node, n8n can combine AI-driven steps with traditional programming for efficient, real-world workflows. For instance, simpler tasks, like validating an email address, do not require AI, whereas a complex tasks, like processing the _content_ of an email or dealing with multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio), are excellent uses of an AI agent."
