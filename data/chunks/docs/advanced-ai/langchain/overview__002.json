The LangChain nodes are configurable, meaning you can choose your preferred agent, LLM, memory, and so on. Alongside the LangChain nodes, you can connect any n8n node as normal: this means you can integrate your LangChain logic with other data sources and services.\n\n* [Learning resources](/advanced-ai/langchain/langchain-learning-resources.md): n8n's documentation for LangChain assumes you're familiar with AI and LangChain concepts. This page provides links to learning resources.\n* [LangChain concepts and features in n8n](/advanced-ai/langchain/langchain-n8n.md): how n8n represents LangChain concepts and features."
