Add a chat model by clicking the plus <span class=\"inline-image\">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> button underneath the **Chat Model** connection on the **AI Agent** node (it's the first connection along the bottom of the node).\n\n1. The search dialog will appear, filtered on 'Language Models'. These are the models with built-in support in n8n. For this tutorial we will use **OpenAI Chat Model**.\n\n1. Selecting the **OpenAI Chat model** from the list will attach it to the **AI Agent** node and open the node editor. One of the parameters which can be changed is the 'Model'. Note that for the basic OpenAI accounts, only the 'gpt-4o-mini' model is allowed.\n\n??? explanation \"Which chat model?\"\n    As mentioned earlier, the LLM is the component which generates the text according to a prompt it is given. LLMs have to be created and trained, usually an intensive process. Different LLMS may have different capabilities or specialties, depending on the data they were trained with."
