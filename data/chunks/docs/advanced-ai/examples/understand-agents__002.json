Where a chain follows a predetermined sequence of calls to different AI components, an agent uses a language model to determine which actions to take.\n\nAgents are the part of AI that act as decision-makers. They can interact with other agents and [tools](/glossary.md#ai-tool). When you send a query to an agent, it tries to choose the best tools to use to answer. Agents adapt to your specific queries, as well as the prompts that configure their behavior."
