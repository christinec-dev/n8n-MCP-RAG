Document loaders can use text splitters to break documents into chunks.\n- Embeddings: these are the tools that turn the data (text, images, and so on) into vectors, and back into raw data. Note that n8n only supports text embeddings.\n- Retrievers: retrievers fetch documents from vector databases. You need to pair them with an embedding to translate the vectors back into data."
