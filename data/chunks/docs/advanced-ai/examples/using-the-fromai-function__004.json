  "content": "## Use the `$fromAI()` function \n\nThe `$fromAI()` function uses AI to dynamically fill in parameters for tools connected to the [Tools AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent.md).\n\n/// note | Only for tools\nThe `$fromAI()` function is only available for tools connected to the AI Agent node. The `$fromAI()` function doesn't work with the [Code](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode.md) tool or with [other non-tool cluster sub-nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/index.md).\n///\n\nTo use the `$fromAI()` function, call it with the required `key` parameter:\n\n```javascript\n{{ $fromAI('email') }}\n```\n\nThe `key` parameter and other arguments to the `$fromAI()` function aren't references to existing values. Instead, think of these arguments as hints that the AI model will use to populate the right data.\n\nFor instance, if you choose a key called `email`, the AI Model will look for an email address in its context, other tools, and input data. In chat workflows, it may ask the user for an email address if it can't find one elsewhere. You can optionally pass other parameters like `description` to give extra context to the AI model."
