The [food discovery demo](https://food-discovery.qdrant.tech/) shows how a vector store can help match pictures based on visual similarities.\n\n> This demo uses data from Delivery Service. Users may like or dislike the photo of a dish, and the app will recommend more similar meals based on how they look. It's also possible to choose to view results from the restaurants within the delivery radius. ([source](https://qdrant.tech/demo/))\n\nFor full technical details, refer to the [Qdrant demo-food-discovery GitHub repository](https://github.com/qdrant/demo-food-discovery)."
