Add credentials (if needed)\n\nIn order for n8n to communicate with the chat model, it will need some [credentials](/credentials/index.md) (login data giving it access to an account on a different online service). If you already have credentials set up for OpenAI, these should appear by default in the credentials selector. Otherwise you can use the Credentials selector to help you add a new credential.\n\n![image showing the credentials dialog for OpenAI](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-tutorial-credentials.png)\n\n1. To add a new credential, click on the text which says 'Select credential'. An option to add a new credential will appear\n   ![Screenshot showing create a new credential button](/_images/advanced-ai/ai-tutorial-create-credential.png)\n\n1. This credential just needs an API key. When adding credentials of any type, check the text to the right-hand side. In this case it has a handy link to take you straight to your OpenAI account to retrieve the API key.\n\n1. The API key is just one long string. That's all you need for this particular credential. Copy it from the OpenAI website and paste it into the **API key** section.\n\n??? explanation \"Keeping your credentials safe\"\n    Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node. The type of information required varies depending on the app/service concerned. You should be careful about sharing or revealing the credentials outside of n8n."
