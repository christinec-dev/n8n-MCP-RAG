When you upload a document, the vector store splits it into chunks and converts each chunk into a vector using an [embedding model](/glossary.md#ai-embedding).\n\nYou can query these vectors using similarity searches, which construct results based on *semantic meaning*, rather than keyword matches. This makes vector stores a powerful foundation for RAG and other AI systems that need to retrieve and reason over large sets of knowledge."
