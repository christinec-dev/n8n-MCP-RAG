Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours).\n\n#### Opting out of telemetry\n\nTelemetry collection is enabled by default. To disable it you can configure the following environment variables.\n\nTo opt out of telemetry events:\n\n```bash\nexport N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false\n```\n\nTo opt out of checking for new versions of n8n:\n\n```bash\nexport N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false\n```\n\nTo disable the templates feature (prevents background health check calls):\n\n```bash\nexport N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false\n```\n\nSee [configuration](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods.md) for more info on how to set environment variables."
