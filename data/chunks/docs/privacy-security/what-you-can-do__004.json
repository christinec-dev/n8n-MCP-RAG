Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes) for more information.\n* Choose to exclude certain nodes. For example, you can disable nodes like Execute Command or SSH. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes) for more information.\n* For maximum privacy, you can [Isolate n8n](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/isolation.md)."
