The data will not be incorporated, used, or retained to train the models of the AI services. Any data will be deleted after 30 days.\n\n#### When n8n shares data\n\nData is only sent to AI services if workspaces have opted in to use the assistant. The Assistant is enabled by default for n8n Cloud users. When a workspace opts in to use the assistant, node-specific data is transmitted only during direct interactions and active sessions with the AI assistant, ensuring no unnecessary data sharing occurs.\n\n#### What n8n shares\n\n- **General Workflow Information**: This includes details about which nodes are present in your workflow, the number of items currently in the workflow, and whether the workflow is active.\n- **Input & Output Schemas of Nodes**: This includes the schema of all nodes with incoming data and the output schema of a node in question. We do not send the actual data value of the schema.\n- **Node Configuration**: This includes the operations, options, and settings chosen in the referenced node.\n- **Code and Expressions**: This includes any code or expressions in the node in question to help with debugging potential issues and optimizations.\n\n#### What n8n doesn't share\n\n- **Credentials**: Any values of the credential fields of your nodes.\n- **Output Data**: The actual data processed by your workflows.\n- **Sensitive Information**: Any personally identifiable information or other sensitive data that could compromise your privacy or security that you have not explicitly mentioned in node parameters or your code of a [Code Node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/index.md)."
