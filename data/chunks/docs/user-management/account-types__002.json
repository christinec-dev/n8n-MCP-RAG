The account type affects the user permissions and access.\n\n/// info | Feature availability\nTo use admin accounts, you need a pro or enterprise plan.\n///\n\n/// note | Account types and role types\nAccount types and role types are different things. Role types are part of [RBAC](/user-management/rbac/index.md). \n\nEvery account has one type. The account can have different [role types](/user-management/rbac/role-types.md) for different [projects](/user-management/rbac/projects.md).\n///\n\n/// note | Create a member-level account for the owner\nn8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see and edit all workflows, credentials, and projects. However, there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.\n///\n\n\n| Permission | Owner | Admin | Member |\n| ---------- |------ | ----- | ------ |\n| Manage own email and password | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Manage own workflows | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| View, create, and use tags | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |\n| Delete tags | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: |\n| View and share all workflows | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: |\n| View, edit, and share all credentials | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: |\n| Set up and use [Source control](/source-control-environments/index.md) | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: |\n| Create [projects](/user-management/rbac/projects.md) | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: |\n| View all projects | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: |\n| Add and remove users | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: |\n| Access the Cloud dashboard | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |"
