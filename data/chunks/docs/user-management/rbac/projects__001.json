Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's [pricing page](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for plan details.\n///\n\nn8n uses projects to group workflows and [credentials](/glossary.md#credential-n8n), and assigns [roles](/user-management/rbac/role-types.md) to users in each project. This means that a single user can have different roles in different projects, giving them different levels of access."
