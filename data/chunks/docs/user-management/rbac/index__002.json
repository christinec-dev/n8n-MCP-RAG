Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's [pricing page](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for plan details.\n///\n\n/// note | Role types and account types\nRole types and [account types](/user-management/account-types.md) are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different [projects](/user-management/rbac/projects.md).\n///\n\nRBAC is a way of managing access to workflows and [credentials](/glossary.md#credential-n8n) based on user roles and projects. You group workflows into projects, and user access depends on the user's project role. This section provides guidance on using RBAC in n8n.\n\n[[% import \"_macros/section-toc.html\" as sectionToc %]]\n\n[[ sectionToc.sectionToc(page) ]]"
