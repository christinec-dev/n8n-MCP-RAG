These settings can be modified for each workflow under \"Workflow Settings,\" or globally using the respective environment variables. Additionally, the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` setting will be enabled by default, with `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` set to 10,000. These default settings are designed to prevent performance degradation when using SQLite. Make sure to configure them according to your individual requirements and system capacity.\n\n[PR #6577](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6577)"
