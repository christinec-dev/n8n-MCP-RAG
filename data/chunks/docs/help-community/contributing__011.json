In return, we'll pay you €1,000 when the referral successfully passes their probationary period.\n\nHere's how this works:\n\n1. **Search**: Have a look at the description and requirements of each role, and consider if someone you know would be a great fit.\n2. **Referral**: Once you've identified a potential candidate, send an email to [Jobs at n8n](mailto:jobs@n8n.io) with the subject line *Employee referral - [job title]* and a short description of the person you're referring (and the reason why). Also, tell your referral to apply for the job through our [careers page](https://n8n.io/careers).\n3. **Evaluation**: We'll screen the application and inform you about the next steps of the hiring process.\n4. **Reward**: As soon as your referral has successfully finished the probationary period, we'll reward you for your efforts by transferring the €1,000 to your bank account."
