  "content": "### Task runners for the Code node in public beta\nWe're introducing a significant performance upgrade to the Code node with our new Task runner system. This enhancement moves JavaScript code execution to a separate process, improving your workflow execution speed while adding better isolation.\n\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n    ![Task runners overview](/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-concept.png)\n    <figcaption>Task runners overview</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nOur benchmarks show up to 6x improvement in workflow executions using Code nodes - from approximately 6 to 35 executions per second. All these improvements happen under the hood, keeping your Code node experience exactly the same.\n\nThe Task runner comes in two modes:\n\n- Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes  \n- External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security\n\nCurrently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners.md). Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes.\n\nTo start using Task runners today, [check out the docs](/hosting/configuration/task-runners.md).\n\n</div>"
