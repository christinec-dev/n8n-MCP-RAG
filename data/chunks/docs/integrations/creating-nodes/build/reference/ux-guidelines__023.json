For this reason, n8n always wants to tell the user:\n\n* **What happened**: a description of the error and what went wrong.\n* **How to solve the problem**: or at least how to get unstuck and continue using n8n without problems. n8n doesn't want users to remain blocked, so use this as an opportunity to guide them to success."
