The settings in this file affect what n8n displays in the **Credentials** modal, and must reflect the authentication requirements of the service you're connecting to.\n\nIn the credentials file, you can use all the [n8n UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md). n8n encrypts the data that's stored using credentials using an encryption key."
