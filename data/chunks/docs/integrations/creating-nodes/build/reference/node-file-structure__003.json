This is required for any npm module.\n* A `nodes` directory, containing the code for your node:\n    * This directory must contain the [base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/index.md), in the format `<node-name>.node.ts`. For example, `MyNode.node.ts`.\n    * n8n recommends including a [codex file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files.md), containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex name is `MyNode.node.json`.\n    * The `nodes` directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure.\n* A `credentials` directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single [credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files.md). The filename format is `<node-name>.credentials.ts`. For example, `MyNode.credentials.ts`."
