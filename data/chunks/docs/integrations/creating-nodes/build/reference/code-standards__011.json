  "content": "### Use the built in request library\n\nSome third-party services have their own libraries on npm, which make it easier to create an integration. The problem with these packages is that you add another dependency (plus all the dependencies of the dependencies). This adds more and more code, which has to be loaded, can introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, and so on. Instead, use the built-in module:\n\n```typescript\n// If no auth needed\nconst response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);\n\n// If auth needed\nconst response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call(\n\tthis, \n\t'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi\n\toptions,\n);\n```\n\nThis uses the npm package [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).\n\nRefer to [HTTP helpers](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/http-helpers.md) for more information, and for migration instructions for the removed `this.helpers.request`."
