  "content": "### Operations objects\n\nThe operations object defines the available operations on a resource.\n\n* `displayName`: String. This should always be `Options`.\n* `name`: String. This should always be `option`.\n* `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `dateTime` results in n8n adding a date picker. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md) for more information.\n* `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `operation`.\n* `options`: Array of objects. Each objects describes an operation's behavior, such as its routing, the REST verb it uses, and so on. An `options` object includes:\n\t* `name`. String.\n\t* `value`. String.\n\t* `action`: String. This parameter combines the resource and operation. You should always include it, as n8n will use it in future versions. For example, given a resource called `\"Card\"` and an operation `\"Get all\"`, your action is `\"Get all cards\"`.\n\t* `description`: String.\n\t* `routing`: Object containing request details."
