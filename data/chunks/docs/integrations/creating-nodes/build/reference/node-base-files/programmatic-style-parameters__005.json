If you want to support multiple versions, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.\n\nn8n support two methods of node versioning. Programmatic-style nodes can use either. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning.md) for more information."
