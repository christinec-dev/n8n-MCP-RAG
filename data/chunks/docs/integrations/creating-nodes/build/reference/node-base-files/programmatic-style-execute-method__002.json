  "content": "# Programmatic-style execute() method\n\nThe main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles requests using the `routing` key in the `operations` object.\n\nThe `execute()` method creates and returns an instance of `INodeExecutionData`.\n\n/// warning | Paired items\nYou must include input and output item pairing information in the data you return. For more information, refer to [Paired items](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/paired-items.md).\n///"
