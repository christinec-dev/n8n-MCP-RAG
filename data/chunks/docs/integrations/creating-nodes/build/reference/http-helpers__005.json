  "content": "## Deprecation of the previous helper\n\nThe previous helper implementation using `this.helpers.request(options)` used and exposed the `request-promise` library. This was removed in version 1.\n\nTo minimize incompatibility, n8n made a transparent conversion to another library called `Axios`.\n\nIf you are having issues, please report them in the [Community Forums](https://community.n8n.io/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues)."
