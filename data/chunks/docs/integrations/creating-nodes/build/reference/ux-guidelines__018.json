In this case, you don't need to repeat the resource.\n\t* For example: `Append Rows` â†’ You have to specify `Rows` because rows are what you're actually appending to. Don't add the resource (`Sheet`) since you aren't appending to the resource.\n\n#### Naming `description`\n\nThis is the subtext displayed below the name in the selection when the node is open on the canvas.\n\n* Parameter: `description`\n* Case: Sentence case\n\nNaming guidelines:\n\n*  If possible, add more information than that specified in the operation `name`\n*  Use alternative wording to help users better understand what the operation is doing. Some people might not understand the text used in the operation (maybe English isn't their native language), and using alternative working could help them.\n\n#### Vocabulary\n\nn8n uses a general vocabulary and some context-specific vocabulary for groups of similar applications (for example, databases or spreadsheets).\n\nThe general vocabulary takes inspiration from CRUD operations:\n\n* **Clear**\n    * Delete all the contents of the resource (empty the resource).\n    * Description: `Delete all the <CHILD_ELEMENT>s inside the <RESOURCE>`\n* **Create**\n    * Create a new instance of the resource.\n    * Description: `Create a new <RESOURCE>`\n* **Create or Update**\n    * Create or update an existing instance of the resource.\n    * Description: `Create a new <RESOURCE> or update an existing one (upsert)`\n* **Delete**\n    * You can use \"Delete\" in two different ways:\n        1. Delete a resource:\n            * Description: `Delete a <RESOURCE> permanently` (use \"permanently\" only if that's the case)\n        2. Delete something **inside** of the resource (for example, a row):\n            * In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Delete Rows` or `Delete Records`.\n            * Description: `Delete a <CHILD_ELEMENT> permanently`\n* **Get**\n    * You can use \"Get\" in two different ways:\n        1. Get a resource:\n            * Description: `Retrieve a <RESOURCE>`\n        2. Get an item **inside** of the resource (for example, records):\n            * In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Get Row` or `Get Record`.\n            * Description: `Retrieve a <CHILD_ELEMENT> from the/a <RESOURCE>`\n* **Get Many**\n    * You can use \"Get Many\" in two different ways:\n        1. Get a list of resources (without filtering):\n            * Description: `Retrieve a list of <RESOURCE>s`\n        2. Get a list of items **inside** of the resource (for example, records):\n            * In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Get Many Rows` or `Get Many Records`.\n            * You can omit `Many`: `Get Many Rows` can be `Get Rows`.\n            * Description: `List all <CHILD_ELEMENT>s in the/a <RESOURCE>`\n* **Insert** or **Append**\n    * Add something inside of a resource.\n    * Use `insert` for database nodes.\n    * Description: `Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) in a <RESOURCE>`\n* **Insert or Update** or **Append or Update**\n    * Add or update something inside of a resource.\n    * Use `insert` for database nodes.\n    * Description: `Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) or update an existing one(s) (upsert)`\n* **Update**\n    * You can use \"Update\" in two different ways:\n        1. Update a resource"
