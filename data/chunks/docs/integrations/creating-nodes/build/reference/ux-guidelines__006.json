The suggested operations are:\n\n* **Create**\n* **Create or Update (Upsert)**\n* **Delete**\n* **Get**\n* **Get Many:** also used when some filtering or search is available\n* **Update**\n\nNotes:\n\n1. These operations can apply to the resource itself or an entity inside of the resource (for example, a row inside a Google Sheet). When operating on an entity inside of the resource, you must specify the **name of the entity** in the operations name.\n2. The naming could change depending on the node and the resource. Check the following guidelines for details."
