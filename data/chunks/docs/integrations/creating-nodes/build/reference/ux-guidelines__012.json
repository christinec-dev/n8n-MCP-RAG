The rationale is that tools may run out of context window and they can get confused by too many fields, so it's better to pass only the ones they need.\n\nOptions:\n\n* **Simplified:** Works the same as the \"Simplify\" parameter described above.\n* **Raw:** Returns all the available fields.\n* **Selected fields:** Shows a multi-option parameter for selecting the fields to add to the output and send to the AI agent. By default, this option always returns the ID of the record/entity."
