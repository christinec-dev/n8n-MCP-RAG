You should strongly consider migrating existing custom nodes to the new helper. These are the main considerations when migrating:\n\n- Accepts `url`. Doesn't accept `uri`.\n- `encoding: null` now must be `encoding: arrayBuffer`.\n- `rejectUnauthorized: false` is now `skipSslCertificateValidation: true`\n- Use `body` according to `content-type` headers to clarify the payload.\n- `resolveWithFullResponse` is now `returnFullResponse` and has similar behavior"
