  "content": "### Operations name, action, and description\n\n* **Name:** This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use title case and doesn't have to include the resource (for example, \"Delete\").\n* **Action:** This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. It must be in sentence case and must include the resource (for example, \"Delete record\").\n* **Description:** This is the sub-text displayed below the name in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use sentence case and must include the resource. It can add a bit of information and use alternative words than the basic resource/operation (for example, \"Retrieve a list of users\").\n* If the operation acts on an entity that's not the Resource (for example, a row in a Google Sheet), specify that in the operation name (for example, \"Delete Row\").\n\nAs a general rule, is important to understand what the **object** of an operation is. Sometimes, the object of an Operation is the resource itself (for example, `Sheet:Delete` to delete a Sheet).\n\nIn other cases, the object of the operation isn't the resource, but something contained inside the resource (for example, `Table:Delete rows`, here the resource is the table, but what you are operating on are the rows inside of it).\n\n#### Naming `name`\n\nThis is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas.\n\n* Parameter: `name`\n* Case: Title Case\n\nNaming guidelines:\n\n* **Don't repeat the resource (if the resource selection is above):** The resource is often displayed above the operation, so it's not necessary to repeat it in the operation (this is the case if the object of the operation is the resource itself).\n\t* For example: `Sheet:Delete` → No need to repeat `Sheet` in `Delete`, because n8n displays `Sheet` in the field above and what you're deleting is the Sheet.\n* **Specify the resource if there's no resource selection above:** In some nodes, you won't have a resource selection (because there's only one resource). In these cases, specify the resource in the operation.\n\t* For example: `Delete Records` → In Airtable, there's no resource selection, so it's better to specify that the Delete operation will delete records.\n* **Specify the object of the operation if it's not the resource:** Sometimes, the object of the operation isn't the resource. In these cases, specify the object in the operation as well.\n\t* For example: `Table:Get Columns` → Specify `Columns` because the resource is `Table`, while the object of the operation is `Columns`.\n\n#### Naming `action`\n\nThis is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node.\n* Parameter: `action`\n* Case: Sentence case\n\nNaming guidelines:\n\n* **Omit articles:** To keep the text shorter, get rid of articles (a, an, the…).\n\t* **correct**: `Update row in sheet`\n\t* **incorrect**: `Update a row in a sheet`\n* **Repeat the resource:** In this case, it's okay to repeat the resource. Even if the resource is visible in the list, the user might not notice and it's useful to repeat it in the operation label.\n*  **Specify the object of the operation if it is not the resource:** Same as for the operation name. In this case, you don't need to repeat the resource.\n\t* For example: `Append Rows` → You have to specify `Rows` because rows are what you're actually appending to. Don't add the resource (`Sheet`) since you aren't appending to the resource.\n\n#### Naming `description`\n\nThis is the subtext displayed below the name in the selection when the node is"
