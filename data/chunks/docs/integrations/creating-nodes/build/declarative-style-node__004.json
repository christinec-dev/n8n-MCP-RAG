  "content": "## Build your node\n\nIn this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). You'll create a node that uses two of NASA's services: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Mars Rover Photos. To keep the code examples short, the node won't implement every available option for the Mars Rover Photos endpoint.\n\n/// note | Existing node\nn8n has a built-in NASA node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.\n///"
