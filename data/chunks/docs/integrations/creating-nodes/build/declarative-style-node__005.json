It also provides a linter. \n\nClone the repository and navigate into the directory:\n\n1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.\n2. Clone your new repository:\n\t\t```shell\n\t\tgit clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-nasa-pics\n\t\tcd n8n-nodes-nasa-pics\n\t\t```\n\nThe starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:\n\n* `nodes/ExampleNode`\n* `nodes/HTTPBin`\n* `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`\n* `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`\n\nNow create the following directories and files:\n\n`nodes/NasaPics`  \n`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.json`  \n`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.ts`  \n`credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`  \n\nThese are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure.md) for more information on required files and recommended organization.\n\nNow install the project dependencies:\n\n```shell\nnpm i\n```"
