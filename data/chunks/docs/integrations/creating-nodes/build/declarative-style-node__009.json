The object named `roverName` requires the user to choose which Rover they want photos from. The `routing` object in the Mars Rover operation references this to create the URL for the API call.\n\n#### Step 3.6: Optional fields\n\nMost APIs, including the NASA API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.\n\nFor this tutorial, you'll add one additional field, to allow users to pick a date to use with the APOD endpoint. Add the following to the properties array:\n\n```typescript\n{\n\tdisplayName: 'Additional Fields',\n\tname: 'additionalFields',\n\ttype: 'collection',\n\tdefault: {},\n\tplaceholder: 'Add Field',\n\tdisplayOptions: {\n\t\tshow: {\n\t\t\tresource: [\n\t\t\t\t'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\toperation: [\n\t\t\t\t'get',\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\toptions: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tdisplayName: 'Date',\n\t\t\tname: 'apodDate',\n\t\t\ttype: 'dateTime',\n\t\t\tdefault: '',\n\t\t\trouting: {\n\t\t\t\trequest: {\n\t\t\t\t\t// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string\n\t\t\t\t\tqs: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdate: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}',\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t],\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n}\n```"
