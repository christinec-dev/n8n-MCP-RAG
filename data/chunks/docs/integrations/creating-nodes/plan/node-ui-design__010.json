For example, **Simplify Output?**. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear.\n    * Use a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, **Append?**. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded).\n\n#### Lists\n\n* Set default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option.\n* Sort list options alphabetically.\n* You can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information.\n* If there is an option like **All**, use the word **All**, not shorthand like *****.\n\n#### Trigger node inputs\n\nWhen a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on:\n\n* Name the parameter **Trigger on**.\n* Don't include a tooltip.\n\n#### Subtitles\n\nSet subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example:\n\n```js\nsubtitle: '={{$parameter[\"operation\"] + \": \" + $parameter[\"resource\"]}}',\n```\n\n#### IDs\n\nWhen performing an operation on a specific record, such as \"update a task comment\" you need a way to specify which record you want to change.\n\n* Wherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record:\n    * By choosing from a pre-populated list. You can generate this list using the `loadOptions` parameter. Refer to [Base files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/index.md) for more information.\n    * By entering an ID.\n* Name the field `<Record name> name or ID`. For example, **Workspace Name or ID**. Add a tooltip saying \"Choose a name from the list, or specify an ID using an expression.\" Link to n8n's [Expressions](/code/expressions.md) documentation.\n* Build your node so that it can handle users providing more information than required. For example:\n    * If you need a relative path, handle the user pasting in the absolute path.\n    * If the user needs to get an ID from a URL, handle the user pasting in the entire URL.\n\n#### Dates and timestamps\n\nn8n uses [ISO timestamp strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats.\n\n#### JSON\n\nYou should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON:\n\n* Typing JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object.\n* Using an expression that returns JSON.\n\n\n\n#### Node icons\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/node-icons.md\""
