You need to do this if using MS 365 (where OneDrive uses SharePoint behind the scenes):\n\t1. Select **Resource** > **Folder**.\n\t2. Select **Operation** > **Search**.\n\t3. In **Query**, enter the folder name.\n\t4. Select **Execute step**. n8n runs the query and returns data about the folder, including an `id` field containing the folder ID."
