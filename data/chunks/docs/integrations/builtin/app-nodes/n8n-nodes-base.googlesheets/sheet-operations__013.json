By default, n8n will detect the range automatically until the last row in the sheet. \n- **Output Formatting**: Use this option to choose how n8n formats the data returned by Google Sheets.\n  - **General Formatting**: \n    - **Values (unformatted)** (default): n8n removes currency signs and other special formatting. Data type remains as number.\n    - **Values (formatted)**: n8n displays the values as they appear in Google Sheets (for example, retaining commas or currency signs) by converting the data type from number to string.\n    - **Formulas**: n8n returns the formula. It doesn't calculate the formula output. For example, if a cell B2 has the formula `=A2`, n8n returns B2's value as `=A2` (in text). Refer to [About date & time values | Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/formats#about_date_time_values) for more information. \n  - **Date Formatting**: Refer to [DateTimeRenderOption | Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/DateTimeRenderOption) for more information.\n     \t- **Formatted Text** (default): As displayed in Google Sheets, which depends on the spreadsheet locale. For example `01/01/2024`.\n     \t- **Serial Number**: Number of days since  December 30th 1899. \n- **When Filter Has Multiple Matches**: Set to **Return All Matches** to get multiple matches. By default only the first result gets returned. \n\n/// note | First row\nn8n treats the first row in a Google Sheet as a heading row, and doesn't return it when reading all rows. If you want to read the first row, use the **Options** to set **Data Location on Sheet**.\n///\n\nRefer to the [Method: spreadsheets.batchUpdate | Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/batchUpdate) API documentation for more information."
