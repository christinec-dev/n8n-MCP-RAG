You must wait after creating a group before you can change the values of these options.\n\nWhen designing workflows that use multiple Microsoft Entra ID nodes to first create groups and then update these options, add a [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait.md) node between the two operations. A Wait node configured to pause for at least two seconds allows time for the group to fully initialize. After the wait, the update operation can complete without erroring."
