  "content": "### If Supabase and n8n are running in separate Docker containers\n\nIf both n8n and Supabase are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.\n\nConfigure Supabase to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official [Docker compose configuration](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already does this this). Add both the Supabase and n8n components to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/) if you aren't already managing them together in the same Docker Compose file.\n\nWhen configuring [Supabase credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/supabase.md), use the Supabase API gateway container's name (`supabase-kong` by default) as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you use the default configuration, you would set the **Host** to `http://supabase-kong:8000`."
