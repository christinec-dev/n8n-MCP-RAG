We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If theyâ€™re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to `1.0`. \n- **Output Randomness (Top P)**: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, `0.5` means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Temperature)** but not both. Defaults to `1.0`. \n- **Fail if Assistant Already Exists**: If enabled, the operation will fail if an assistant with the same name already exists. \n\nRefer to [Create assistant | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants/createAssistant) documentation for more information."
