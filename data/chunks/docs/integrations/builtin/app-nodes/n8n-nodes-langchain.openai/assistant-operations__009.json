This option is useful for directing the assistant to use endpoints provided by other LLM providers that offer an OpenAI-compatible API.\n- **Max Retries**: Specify the number of times the assistant should retry an operation in case of failure. \n- **Timeout**: Set the maximum amount of time in milliseconds, that the assistant should wait for a response before timing out. Use this option to prevent long waits during operations.\n- **Preserve Original Tools**: Turn off to remove the original tools associated with the assistant. Use this if you want to temporarily remove tools for this specific operation.\n\nRefer to [Assistants | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants) documentation for more information."
