Enable this tool for tasks that require computations, data analysis, or any logic-based processing.\n- **Description**: Enter the description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.\n  ```\n  A virtual assistant that helps users with daily tasks, including setting reminders, answering general questions, and providing quick information.\n  ```\n- **Instructions**: Enter the system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 32,768 characters. Use this to specify the persona used by the model in its replies. \n  ```\n  Always respond in a friendly and engaging manner. When a user asks a question, provide a concise answer first, followed by a brief explanation or additional context if necessary. If the question is open-ended, offer a suggestion or ask a clarifying question to guide the conversation. Keep the tone positive and supportive, and avoid technical jargon unless specifically requested by the user.\n  ```\n- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Turn on to enable knowledge retrieval for the assistant, allowing it to access external sources or a connected knowledge base. Refer to [File Search | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search) for more information. \n- **Files**: Select a file to upload for your external knowledge source. Use [**Upload a File**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/file-operations.md#upload-a-file) operation to add more files. Note that this only updates the [Code Interpreter](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/code-interpreter) tool, not the [File Search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search) tool.\n- **Model**: Select the model that the assistant will use. If you’re not sure which model to use, try `gpt-4o` if you need high intelligence or `gpt-4o-mini` if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to [Models overview | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for more information. \n- **Name**: Enter the name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.\n- **Remove All Custom Tools (Functions)**: Turn on to remove all custom tools (functions) from the assistant. \n- **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to `1.0`. \n- **Output Randomness (Top P)**: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, `0.5` means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Temperature)** but not both. Defaults to `1.0`. \n\nRefer to [Modify assistant | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants/modifyAssistant) documentation for more information."
