The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If theyâ€™re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. \n\nRefer to [Create transcription | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createTranscription) documentation for more information."
