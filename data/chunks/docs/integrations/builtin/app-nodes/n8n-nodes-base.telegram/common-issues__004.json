To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.\n\nThere are three ways to get that ID:\n\n1. From the Telegram Trigger: Use the [Telegram Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/index.md) node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.\n2. From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter \"g.\" Prefix your group Chat ID with a `-` when you enter it in n8n.\n3. Invite Telegram's [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a `chat` object. The `id` for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group."
