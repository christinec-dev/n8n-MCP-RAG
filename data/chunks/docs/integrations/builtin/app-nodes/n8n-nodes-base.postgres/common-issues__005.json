  "content": "## Outputting Date columns as date strings instead of ISO datetime strings \n\nn8n's uses the [`pg` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) to integrate with Postgres, which affects how n8n processes date, timestamp, and related types from Postgres.\n\nThe `pg` package parses `DATE` values into `new Date(row_value)` by default, which produces a date that follows the [ISO 8601 datetime string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations) format. For example, a date of `2025-12-25` might produce a datetime sting of `2025-12-25T23:00:00.000Z` depending on the instance's timezone settings.\n\nTo work around this, use the [Postgres `TO_CHAR` function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-formatting.html#FUNCTIONS-FORMATTING) to format the date into the expected format at query time:\n\n```sql\nSELECT TO_CHAR(date_col, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS date_col_as_date FROM table_with_date_col\n```\n\nThis will produce the date as a string without the time or timezone components. To continue the earlier example, with this casting, a date of `2025-12-25` would produce the string `2025-12-25`. You can find out more in the [`pg` package documentation on dates](https://node-postgres.com/features/types#date--timestamp--timestamptz)."
