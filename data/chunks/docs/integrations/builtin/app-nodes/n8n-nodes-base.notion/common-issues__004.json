Creating toggleable headings isn't yet supported by the Notion node itself.\n\nYou can work around this be creating a regular heading and then modifying it to enable the [`is_toggleable` property](https://developers.notion.com/reference/block#headings):\n\n1. Add a heading with Notion node.\n2. Select the resource you want to add a heading to:\n\t* To add a new page with a heading, select the **Page** or **Database Page** resources with the **Create** operation.\n\t* To add a heading to an existing page, select the **Block** resource with the **Append After** operation.\n3. Select **Add Block** and set the **Type Name or ID** to either **Heading 1**, **Heading 2**, or **Heading 3**.\n4. Add an [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node connected to the Notion node and select the `GET` method.\n5. Set the **URL** to `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/<block_ID>`. For example, if your added the heading to an existing page, you could use the following URL: `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.results[0].id }}`. If you created a new page instead of appending a block, you may need to discover the block ID by querying the page contents first.\n6. Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.\n7. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md) node after the HTTP Request node.\n8. Add `heading_1.is_toggleable` as a new **Boolean** field set to `true`. Swap `heading_1` for a different heading number as necessary.\n9. Add a second HTTP Request node after the Edit Fields (Set) node.\n10. Set the **Method** to `PATCH` and use `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.id }}` as the **URL** value.\n11. Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.\n12. Enable **Send Body** and set a parameter.\n13. Set the parameter **Name** to `heading_1` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).\n14. Set the parameter **Value** to `{{ $json.heading_1 }}` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).\n\nThe above sequence will create a regular heading block. It will query the newly created header, add the `is_toggleable` property, and update the heading block."
