  "content": "## Relation property not displaying\n\nThe Notion node only supports displaying the data relation property for [two-way relations](https://www.notion.com/help/relations-and-rollups). When you connect two Notion databases with a two-way relationship, you can select or filter by the relation property when working with the Notion node's **Database Page** resource.\n\nTo enable two-way relations, edit the relation property in Notion and enable the **Show on [name of related database]** option to create a reverse relation. Select a name to use for the relation in the new context. The relation is now accessible in n8n when filtering or selecting.\n\nIf you need to work with Notion databases with one-way relationship, you can use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) with your existing Notion credentials. For example, to update a one-way relationship, you can send a `PATCH` request to the following URL:\n\n```\nhttps://api.notion.com/v1/pages/<page_id>\n```\n\nEnable **Send Body**, set the **Body Content Type** to **JSON**, and set **Specify Body** to **Using JSON**.  Afterward, you can enter a JSON object like the following into the **JSON** field:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"properties\": {\n\t\t\"Account\": {\n\t\t\t\"relation\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"<your_relation_ID>\"\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```"
