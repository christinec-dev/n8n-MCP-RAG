There are two ways to get the Row ID:\n\n**Create a Row ID column in Grist**\n\nCreate a new column in your Grist table with the formula `$id`.\n\n**Use the Get All operation**\n\nThe **Get All** operation returns the Row ID of each record along with the fields.\n \nYou can get it with the expression `{{$node[\"GristNodeName\"].json[\"id\"]}}`."
