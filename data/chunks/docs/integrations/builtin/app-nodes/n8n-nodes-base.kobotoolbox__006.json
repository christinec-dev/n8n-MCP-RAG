  "content": "### Query Options\n\nThe Query Submission operation supports query options:\n\n* In the main section of the **Parameters** panel:\n    * **Start** controls the index offset to start the query from (to use the API pagination logic).\n    * **Limit** sets the maximum number of records to return. Note that the API always has a limit of 30,000 returned records, whatever value you provide.\n* In the **Query Options** section, you can activate the following parameters:\n    * **Query** lets you specify filter predicates in MongoDB's JSON query format. For example: `{\"status\": \"success\", \"_submission_time\": {\"$lt\": \"2021-11-01T01:02:03\"}}` queries for all submissions with the value `success` for the field `status`, and submitted before November 1st, 2021, 01:02:03.\n    * **Fields** lets you specify the list of fields you want to fetch, to make the response lighter.\n    * **Sort** lets you provide a list of sorting criteria in MongoDB JSON format. For example, `{\"status\": 1, \"_submission_time\": -1}` specifies a sort order by ascending status, and then descending submission time.\n\nMore details about these options can be found in the [Formhub API docs](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub/wiki/Formhub-Access-Points-(API)#api-parameters)"
