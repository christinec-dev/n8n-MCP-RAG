These include:\n\n- Download options lets you download any attachment linked to each particular form submissions, such as pictures and videos. It also lets you select the naming pattern, and the file size to download (if available - typically for images). \n- Formatting options perform some reformatting as described in [About reformatting](#about-reformatting).\n\n#### About reformatting\n\nThe default JSON format for KoboToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it's not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings.\n\nThis node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the **Reformat?** parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions: the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations.\n\nWhen enabled, the reformatting:\n\n- Reorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a `/` character in the field names, for example `Group1/Question1`. With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into `Group1.Question1`, as nested JSON objects.\n- Renames fields to trim `_` (not supported by many downstream systems).\n- Parses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent.\n- Splits all fields matching any of the **Multiselect Mask** wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they can't be guessed algorithmically, so you must provide a field naming mask. Format the masks as a comma-separated list. Lists support the `*` wildcard.\n- Converts all fields matching any of the **Number Mask** wildcard masks into a JSON float.\n\nHere's a detailed example in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_id\": 471987,\n  \"formhub/uuid\": \"189436bb09a54957bfcc798e338b54d6\",\n  \"start\": \"2021-12-05T16:13:38.527+02:00\",\n  \"end\": \"2021-12-05T16:15:33.407+02:00\",\n  \"Field_Details/Field_Name\": \"Test Fields\",\n  \"Field_Details/Field_Location\": \"-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165\",\n  \"Field_Details/Field_Shape\": \"-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165;-1.933011 30.078085 0 0;-1.933257 30.078004 0 0;-1.933338 30.078197 0 0;-1.933107 30.078299 0 0;-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165\",\n  \"Field_Details/Crops_Grown\": \"maize beans avocado\",\n  \"Field_Details/Field_Size_sqm\": \"2300\",\n  \"__version__\": \"veGcULpqP6JNFKRJbbMvMs\",\n  \"meta/instanceID\": \"uuid:2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\",\n  \"_xform_id_string\": \"ajXVJpBkTD5tB4Nu9QXpgm\",\n  \"_uuid\": \"2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\",\n  \"_attachments\": [],\n  \"_status\": \"submitted_via_web\",\n  \"_geolocation\": [\n    -1.932914,\n    30.078211\n  ],\n  \"_submission_time\": \"2021-12-05T14:15:44\",\n  \"_tags\": [],"
