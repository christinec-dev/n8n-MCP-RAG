For example, if you enter `attachment_' as the prefix, the first attachment saves to 'attachment_0'.\n* **Download Attachments**: Select whether the node should download the draft's attachments (turned on) or not (turned off).\n\nRefer to the [Gmail API Method: users.drafts.get](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.drafts/get) documentation for more information.\n\n<!-- vale off -->"
