  "content": "## Workflow only works in testing or production\n\nTelegram only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Telegram overwrites the registered webhook URL. \n\nYou may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. The Telegram bot will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.\n\nTo work around this, you can either disable your workflow when testing or create separate Telegram bots for testing and production.\n\nTo create a separate telegram bot for testing, repeat the process you completed to create your first bot. Reference [Telegram's bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and the [Telegram bot API reference](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for more information.\n\nTo disable your workflow when testing, try the following:\n\n/// warning | Halts production traffic\nThis workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.\n///\n\n1. Go to your workflow page.\n2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.\n3. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.\n4. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working."
