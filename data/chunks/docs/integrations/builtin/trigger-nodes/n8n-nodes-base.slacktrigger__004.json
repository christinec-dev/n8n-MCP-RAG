Use with caution!\n    ///\n\n* **Channel to Watch**: Select the channel your node should watch for the selected **Events**. This parameter only appears if you don't turn on **Watch Whole Workspace**.

Slack displays the channel ID at the bottom of the channel details with a one-click copy button.\n    * **By URL**: Enter the URL of the channel you want to watch, formatted as `https://app.slack.com/client/<channel-address>`.\n* **Download Files**: Whether to download files and use them in the node's output (turned on) or not (turned off, default).
