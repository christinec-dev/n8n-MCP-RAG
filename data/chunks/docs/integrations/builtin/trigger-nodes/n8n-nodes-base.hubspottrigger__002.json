This is because the trigger registers a new webhook with HubSpot when activated. HubSpot only allows one webhook at a time. \n///\n\n/// note | Credentials\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/hubspot.md).\n///\n\n/// note | Examples and templates\nFor usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [HubSpot Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/hubspot-trigger/) page.\n///"
