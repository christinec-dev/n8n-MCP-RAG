  "content": "### Workflow only works in testing or production\n\nSlack only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that you can't switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa) without reconfiguring the registered webhook URL. \n\nYou may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Slack will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.\n\nTo work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:\n\n/// warning | Halts production traffic\nThis temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.\n///\n\n1. Go to your workflow page.\n2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.\n3. Edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack.md#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the testing webhook URL instead of the production webhook URL.\n4. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.\n5. When you finish testing, edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack.md#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the production webhook URL instead of the testing webhook URL.\n6. Toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working."
