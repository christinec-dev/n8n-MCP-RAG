When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.\n    * To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.\n    * Make sure any expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.\n2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.\n    * To resolve, make sure your input contains a `chatInput` field. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`.\n    * Remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.\n\n<!-- vale from-write-good.Passive = NO -->"
