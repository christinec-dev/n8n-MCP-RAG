You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](/glossary.md#ai-chain), or connect directly to an [agent](/glossary.md#ai-agent) as a [tool](/glossary.md#ai-tool). You can also update an item in a vector database by its ID.\n\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Pinecone node, and links to more resources.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/pinecone.md).\n///\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-node-expression-resolution.md\""
