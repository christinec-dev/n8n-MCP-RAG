  "content": "### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions\n\nAnother pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore.md) to summarize results and answer questions from the Weaviate Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Weaviate Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store."
