  "content": "### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions\n\nAnother pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore.md) to summarize results and answer questions from the Milvus Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Milvus Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.\n\nThe connections flow would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Milvus Vector store."
