Rather than connecting the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarize data in the vector store.\n\nThe [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) (the linked example uses the In-Memory Vector Store, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> In-Memory Vector store."
