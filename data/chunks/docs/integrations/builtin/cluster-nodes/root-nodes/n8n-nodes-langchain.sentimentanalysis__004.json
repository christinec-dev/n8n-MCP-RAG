  "content": "## Node options\n\n* **Sentiment Categories**: Define the categories that you want to classify your input as.\n    * By default, these are `Positive, Neutral, Negative`. You can customize these categories to fit your specific use case, such as `Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative` for more granular analysis.\n* **Include Detailed Results**: When turned on, this option includes sentiment strength and confidence scores in the output. Note that these scores are estimates generated by the language model and are rough indicators rather than precise measurements.\n* **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the sentiment analysis. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.\n* **Enable Auto-Fixing**: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it."
