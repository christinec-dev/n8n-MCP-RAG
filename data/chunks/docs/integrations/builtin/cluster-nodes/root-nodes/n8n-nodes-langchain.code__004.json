You can only use one mode.\n\nUnlike the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/index.md), the LangChain Code node doesn't support Python.\n\n* **Execute**: use the LangChain Code node like n8n's own Code node. This takes input data from the workflow, processes it, and returns it as the node output. This mode requires a main input and output. You must create these connections in **Inputs** and **Outputs**.\n* **Supply Data**: use the LangChain Code node as a sub-node, sending data to a root node. This uses an output other than main.\n\nBy default, you can't load built-in or external modules in this node. Self-hosted users can [enable built-in and external modules](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods.md)."
