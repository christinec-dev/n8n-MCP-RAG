You can insert documents into a vector database, get many documents from a vector database, and retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain. \n\nUse the Supabase Vector Store to interact with your Supabase database as [vector store](/glossary.md#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](/glossary.md#ai-chain), or connect it directly to an [agent](/glossary.md#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](/glossary.md#ai-tool). You can also update an item in a vector store by its ID.\n\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Supabase node, and links to more resources.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/supabase.md).\n///\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-node-expression-resolution.md\"\n\t\nSupabase provides a [quickstart for setting up your vector store](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/langchain?database-method=sql). If you use settings other than the defaults in the quickstart, this may affect parameter settings in n8n. Make sure you understand what you're doing."
