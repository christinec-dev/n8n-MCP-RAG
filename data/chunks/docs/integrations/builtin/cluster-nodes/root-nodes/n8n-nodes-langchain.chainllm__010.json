When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and haven't entered anything in the **Text** field.\n    * To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.\n2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has no field called `chatInput`. \n    * The node expects the `chatInput` field. If your previous node doesn't have this field, add an [Edit Fields (Set)](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`."
