By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors you can use it as a normal node, root node or sub-node.\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters, guidance on configuring the node, and links to more resources.\n\n/// note | Not available on Cloud\nThis node is only available on self-hosted n8n.\n///"
