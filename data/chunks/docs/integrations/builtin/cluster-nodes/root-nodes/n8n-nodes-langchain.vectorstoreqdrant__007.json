Rather than connecting the Qdrant Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.\n\nThe [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2464-scale-deal-flow-with-a-pitch-deck-ai-vision-chatbot-and-qdrant-vector-store/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Qdrant Vector store."
