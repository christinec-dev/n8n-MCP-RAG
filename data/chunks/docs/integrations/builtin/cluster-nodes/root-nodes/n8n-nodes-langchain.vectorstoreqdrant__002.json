You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](/glossary.md#ai-chain) or connect it directly to an [agent](/glossary.md#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](/glossary.md#ai-tool).\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Qdrant node, and links to more resources.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/qdrant.md).\n///\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-node-expression-resolution.md\""
