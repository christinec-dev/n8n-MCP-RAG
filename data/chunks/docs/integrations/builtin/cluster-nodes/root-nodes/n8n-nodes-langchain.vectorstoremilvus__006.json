This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/index.md) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.\n\nA typical node connection flow looks like this: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Milvus Vector Store.\n\nCheck out this [workflow example](https://n8n.io/workflows/3574-create-a-paul-graham-essay-qanda-system-with-openai-and-milvus-vector-database/) to see how to ingest external data into Milvus and build a chat-based semantic Q&A system."
