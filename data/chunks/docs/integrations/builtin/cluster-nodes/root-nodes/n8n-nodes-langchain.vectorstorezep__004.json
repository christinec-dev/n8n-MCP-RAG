This pattern places the Zep Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.\n\nYou can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same)."
