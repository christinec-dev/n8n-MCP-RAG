It first creates a high-level plan to solve the given task and then executes the plan step by step. This agent is most useful for tasks that require a structured approach and careful planning.\n\nRefer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) for more information on the AI Agent node itself."
