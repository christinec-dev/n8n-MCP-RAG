  "content": "## No prompt specified error\n\nThis error occurs when the agent expects to get the prompt from the previous node automatically. Typically, this happens when you're using the [Chat Trigger Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/). \n\nTo resolve this issue, find the **Prompt** parameter of the AI Agent node and change it from **Connected Chat Trigger Node** to **Define below**. This allows you to manually build your prompt by referencing output data from other nodes or by adding static text."
