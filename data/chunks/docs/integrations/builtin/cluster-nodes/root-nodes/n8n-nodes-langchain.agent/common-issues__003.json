When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.\n    * To resolve, make sure your expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.\n2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.\n    * To resolve, remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node."
