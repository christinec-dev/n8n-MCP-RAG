It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task. This agent helps integrate LLMs with various external services and databases.\n\nThis agent has an enhanced ability to work with tools and can ensure a standard output format.\n\nThe Tools Agent implements [Langchain's tool calling](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/) interface. This interface describes available tools and their schemas. The agent also has improved output parsing capabilities, as it passes the parser to the model as a formatting tool.\n\nRefer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/use-with-chat-trigger.md\"\n\nThis agent supports the following chat models:\n\n* [OpenAI Chat Model](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/index.md)\n* [Groq Chat Model](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatgroq.md)\n* [Mistral Cloud Chat Model](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatmistralcloud.md)\n* [Anthropic Chat Model](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatanthropic.md)\n* [Azure OpenAI Chat Model](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatazureopenai.md)\n\n???
