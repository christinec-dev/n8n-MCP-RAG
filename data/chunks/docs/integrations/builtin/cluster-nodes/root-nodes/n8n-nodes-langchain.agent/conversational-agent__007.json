Provide some context or explanation about who should use the tools and how they should use them.\n* `{format_instructions}`: A LangChain expression that provides the schema or format from the output parser node you've connected. Since the instructions themselves are context, you don't need to provide context for this expression.\n* `{{input}}`: A LangChain variable containing the user's prompt. This variable populates with the value of the **Prompt** parameter. Provide some context that this is the user's input.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use these strings:\n\nExample:\n\n```\nTOOLS\n------\nAssistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the user's original question. The tools the human can use are:\n\n{tools}\n\n{format_instructions}\n\nUSER'S INPUT\n--------------------\nHere is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a JSON blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):\n\n{{input}}\n```"
