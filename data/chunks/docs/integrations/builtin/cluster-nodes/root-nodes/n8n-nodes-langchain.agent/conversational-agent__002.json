It can maintain context, understand user intent, and provide relevant answers. This agent is typically used for building chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems.\n\nThe Conversational Agent describes [tools](/glossary.md#ai-tool) in the system prompt and parses JSON responses for tool calls. If your preferred AI model doesn't support tool calling or you're handling simpler interactions, this agent is a good general option. It's more flexible but may be less accurate than the [Tools Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent.md).\n\nRefer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/use-with-chat-trigger.md\""
