  "content": "### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool\n\nYou can connect the Milvus Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.\n\nHere, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Milvus Vector Store node. See this [example template](https://n8n.io/workflows/3576-paul-graham-essay-search-and-chat-with-milvus-vector-database/) where data is embedded and indexed in Milvus, and the AI Agent uses the vector store as a knowledge tool for question-answering."
