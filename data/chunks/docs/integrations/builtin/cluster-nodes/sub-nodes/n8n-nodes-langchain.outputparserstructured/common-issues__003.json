  "content": "## Processing parameters\n\nThe Structured Output Parser node is a [sub-node](/glossary.md#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.\n\nMost nodes, including [root nodes](/glossary.md#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name."
