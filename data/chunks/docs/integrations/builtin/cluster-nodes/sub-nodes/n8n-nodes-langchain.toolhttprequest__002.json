This page is describes the legacy, standalone HTTP Request tool node.\n\nYou can identify which tool version is in your workflow by checking if the node has an **Add option** property when you open the node on the canvas. If that button is present, you're using the new version, not the one described on this page.\n///\n\nThe HTTP Request tool works just like the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node, but it's designed to be used with an [AI agent](/glossary.md#ai-agent) as a tool to collect information from a website or API.\n\nOn this page, you'll find a list of operations the HTTP Request node supports and links to more resources.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nRefer to [HTTP Request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md) for guidance on setting up authentication. \n///\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-node-expression-resolution.md\""
