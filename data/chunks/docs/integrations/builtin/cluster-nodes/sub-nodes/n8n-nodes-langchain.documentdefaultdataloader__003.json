You can add text as well as expressions. This means you can create a custom document from a mix of text and expressions.\n* **Data Format**: Displays when you set **Type of Data** to **Binary**. Select the file MIME type for your binary data. Set to **Automatically Detect by MIME Type** if you want n8n to set the data format for you. If you set a specific data format and the incoming file MIME type doesn't match it, the node errors. If you use **Automatically Detect by MIME Type**, the node falls back to text format if it can't match the file MIME type to a supported data format."
