Add the Loop Over Items node before the node that calls the API. Refer to [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches.md) for information on how to configure the node.\n1. Add the Wait node after the node that calls the API, and connect it back to the Loop Over Items node. Refer to [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait.md) for information on how to configure the node.\n\nFor example, to handle rate limits when using OpenAI:\n\n![\"Screenshot of a workflow using the Loop Over Items node and Wait node to handle API rate limits for the OpenAI APIs\"](/_images/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/loop-wait.png)"
