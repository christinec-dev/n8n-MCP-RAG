This is the equivalent of using Loop Over Items and Wait.\n\n1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Batching**.\n1. Set **Items per Batch**: this is the number of input items to include in each request.\n1. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait."
