Open your [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page.\n2. Select **Create New App > From scratch**.\n3. Enter an **App Name**.\n4. Select the **Workspace** where you'll be developing your app.\n5. Select **Create App**. The app details open.\n6. In **Settings > Basic Information**, open the **App Credentials** section.\n7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Paste these into the corresponding fields in n8n.\n6. In the left menu under **Features**, select **OAuth & Permissions**.\n7. In the **Redirect URLs** section, select **Add New Redirect URL**.\n8. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it as the new Redirect URL in Slack.\n9. Select **Add**.\n10.
