Refer to [Creating authentication tokens](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.2.1/Security/CreateAuthTokens) for more information.\n- A **Base URL**: For your Splunk instance. This should include the protocol, domain, and port, for example: `https://localhost:8089`.\n- **Allow Self-Signed Certificates**: If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails."
