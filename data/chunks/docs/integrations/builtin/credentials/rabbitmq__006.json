The RabbitMQ logs show an error like this:\n\n    [error] <0.918.0> PLAIN login refused: user 'guest' can only connect via localhost\n\nThis happens because RabbitMQ prohibits the default `guest` user from connecting from remote hosts. It can only connect over the `localhost`.\n\nTo resolve this error, you can:\n\n- Update the `guest` user to allow it remote host access.\n- Create or use a different user to connect to the remote host. The `guest` user is the only user limited by default.\n\nRefer to [\"guest\" user can only connect from localhost](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#loopback-users) for more information."
