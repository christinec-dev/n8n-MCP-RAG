Refer to [Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/) for more information.\n\nTo configure this credential, select **Client Credentials** as the **Grant Type**.\n\nThen enter:\n\n- An **Access Token URL**: The URL to hit to begin the OAuth2 flow. Typically this URL ends in `/token`.\n- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to use to log in to the client.\n- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in to the client.\n- _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. Most services don't support scopes for Client Credentials grant types; only enter scopes here if yours does.\n- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:\n\t- **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.\n\t- **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.\n- _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails."
