Go to the app's **Settings > Settings**.\n2. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**.\n3. Overwrite the app's existing **OAuth Redirect URL** with that URL.\n4. Select **Submit Changes**.\n5. Be sure the **Scopes** section contains the [Required app scopes](#required-app-scopes).\n\nFrom the app's **Settings > Credentials**, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and add them to your n8n credential. You can now select **Connect my account** from n8n.\n\n/// note | SurveyMonkey Test OAuth Flow\nThis option only works if you keep the default SurveyMonkey **OAuth Redirect URL** and add the n8n OAuth Redirect URL as an **Additional Redirect URL**.\n///"
