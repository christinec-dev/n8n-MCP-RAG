The auth flow uses the redirect URL to return the user to the client. Then the application gets the authorization code from the URL and uses it to request an access token. Refer to [Authorization Code Request](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/) for more information.\n\nTo configure this credential, select **Authorization Code** as the **Grant Type**.\n\nThen enter:\n\n- An **Authorization URL**\n- An **Access Token URL**\n- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.\n- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.\n- _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.\n- _Optional:_ Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.\n- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:\n\t- **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.\n\t- **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.\n- _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails."
