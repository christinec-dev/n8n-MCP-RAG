To create an API token, go to your **user menu > Profile/Password > API Tokens** and select the option to **Create New Token**. Select **Custom Permissions** to enter a name for your token and adjust the permissions to match your requirements.\n- Your **Subdomain**: Enter your SyncroMSP subdomain. This is visible in the URL of your SyncroMSP, located between `https://` and `.syncromsp.com`. If your full URL is `https://n8n-instance.syncromsp.com`, you'd enter `n8n-instance` as the subdomain.\n\nRefer to [API Tokens](https://community.syncromsp.com/t/api-tokens/2297) for more information on creating new tokens."
