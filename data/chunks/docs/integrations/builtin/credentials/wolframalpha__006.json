Go to your [Wolfram ID Details](https://account.wolfram.com/wolframid).\n2. If you don't see the **Verified** label underneath your **Email address**, select the link to **Send a verification email**.\n3. You must open the link in that email to verify your email address.\n\nIt may take several minutes for the verification to populate to the API, but once it does, retrying the n8n credential should succeed."
