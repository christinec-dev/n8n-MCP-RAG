Open the [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) within the Dropbox developer portal.\n2. Select **Create app**.\n3. In **Choose an API**, select **Scoped access**.\n4. In **Choose the type of access you need**, choose whichever option best fits your use of the [Dropbox](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox.md) node:\n    - **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.\n    - **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.\n    - Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.\n5. In **Name your app**, enter a name for your app, like `n8n integration`.\n6. Check the box to agree to the **Dropbox API Terms and Conditions**.\n7. Select **Create app**. The app's **Settings** open.\n8. In the **OAuth 2** section, in **Generated access token**, select **Generate**.\n9. Copy the access token and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.\n10. In n8n, select the same **App Access Type** you selected for your app.\n\nRefer to the [Dropbox App Console Settings documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/getting-started) for more information.\n\n/// warning | User limits\nOn the **Settings** tab, you can add other users to your app, even with the access token method. Once your app links 50 Dropbox users, you will have two weeks to apply for and receive production status approval before Dropbox freezes your app from linking more users.\n///"
