In Nextcloud, open your **Administrator Security Settings**.\n2. Find the **Add client** section under **OAuth 2.0 clients**.\n3. Enter a **Name** for your client, like `n8n integration`.\n4. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Redirection URI**.\n5. Then select **Add** in Nextcloud.\n6. In n8n, update the **Authorization URL** to replace `https://nextcloud.example.com` with the URL you use to access Nextcloud. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, the Authorization URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/apps/oauth2/authorize`.\n7. In n8n, update the **Access Token URL** to replace `https://nextcloud.example.com` with the URL you use to access Nextcloud. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, the Access Token URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`.\n\n    /// note | Pretty URL configuration\n    The **Authorization URL** and **Access Token URL** assume that you've configured Nextcloud to use [Pretty URLs](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#pretty-urls). If you haven't, you must add `/index.php/` between your Nextcloud URL and the `/apps/oauth2` portion, for example: `https://cloud.n8n.com/index.php/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`.\n    ///\n    \n8. Copy the Nextcloud **Client Identifier** for your OAuth2 client and enter it as the **Client ID** in n8n.\n9. Copy the Nextcloud **Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** in n8n.\n10. In n8n, to create your **Web DAV URL**: If Nextcloud is in the root of your domain, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/remote.php/webdav/`. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, your WebDAV URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/remote.php/webdav`.\n    - If you have Nextcloud installed in a subdirectory, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/<subdirectory>/remote.php/webdav/`. Replace `<subdirectory>` with the subdirectory Nextcloud's installed in.\n    - Refer to Nextcloud's [Third-party WebDAV clients](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/user_manual/en/files/access_webdav.html#third-party-webdav-clients) documentation for more information on constructing your WebDAV URL.\n\nRefer to the Nextcloud [OAuth2 Configuration documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/oauth2.html) for more detailed instructions."
