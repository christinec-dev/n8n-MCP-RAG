The Redirect URL should be a URL in your domain, for example: `https://mytemplatemaker.example.com/gr_callback`. If your n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** contains localhost, refer below to [Local environment redirect URL](#local-environment-redirect-url) for generating a URL that Twist will allow.\n    ///\n\n- Select **Update OAuth settings** to save those changes.\n- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Twist and enter them in the appropriate fields in n8n."
