Enter your Odoo server or site URL as the **Site URL**.\n2. Enter your **Username** as it's displayed on your **Change password** screen in Odoo.\n3. To use a password, enter your user password in the **Password or API key** field.\n4. Enter your Odoo **Database name**, also known as the instance name.\n\n/// note | Password compatibility\nIf you try a password credential and it doesn't work for a specific node function, try switching to an API key.
