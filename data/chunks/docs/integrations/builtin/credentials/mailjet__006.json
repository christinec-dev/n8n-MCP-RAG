  "content": "## Using Email API key\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- An **API Key**: View and generate API keys in your Mailjet [API Key Management](https://app.mailjet.com/account/api_keys) page.\n- A **Secret Key**: View your API Secret Keys in your Mailjet [API Key Management](https://app.mailjet.com/account/api_keys) page.\n- _Optional:_ Select whether to use **Sandbox Mode** for calls made using this credential. When turned on, all API calls use Sandbox mode: the API will still validate the payloads but won't deliver the actual messages. This can be useful to troubleshoot any payload error messages without actually sending messages. Refer to Mailjet's [Sandbox Mode documentation](https://dev.mailjet.com/email/guides/send-api-v31/#sandbox-mode) for more information.\n\nFor this credential, you can use either:\n\n- Mailjet's primary API key and secret key\n- A subaccount API key and secret key\n\nRefer to Mailjet's [How to create a subaccount (or additional API key) documentation](https://documentation.mailjet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042561974-How-to-create-a-subaccount-or-additional-API-Key) for detailed instructions on creating more API keys. Refer to [What are subaccounts and how does it help me?](https://documentation.mailjet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042561854-What-are-subaccounts-and-how-does-it-help-me) page for more information on Mailjet subaccounts and when you might want to use one."
