For all functionality within the [Zammad](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.zammad.md) node, select:\n        - `admin.group`\n        - `admin.organization`\n        - `admin.user`\n        - `ticket.agent`\n        - `ticket.customer`\n- **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails."
