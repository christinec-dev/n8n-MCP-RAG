In the HTTP Request node **Settings**, turn on **SSL Certificates**.\n2. On the **Parameters** tab, add an existing SSL Certificate credential to **Credential for SSL Certificates** or create a new one.\n\nTo configure your SSL Certificates credential, you'll need to add:\n\n- The Certificate Authority **CA** bundle\n- The **Certificate** (CRT): May also appear as a Public Key, depending on who your issuing CA was and how they format the cert\n- The **Private Key** (KEY)\n- _Optional:_ If the **Private Key** is encrypted, enter a **Passphrase** for the private key.\n\nIf your SSL certificate is in a single file (such as a `.pfx` file), you'll need to open the file to copy details from it to paste into the appropriate fields:\n\n- Enter the Public Key/CRT as the **Certificate**\n- Enter the **Private Key**/KEY in that field"
