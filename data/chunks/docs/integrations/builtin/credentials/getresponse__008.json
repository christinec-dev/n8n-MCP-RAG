Follow the steps below to configure the OAuth credentials for a local environment:\n1. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the local server running on port `5678` to the internet. In your terminal, run the following command:\n```sh\nngrok http 5678\n```\n2. Run the following command in a new terminal. Replace `<YOUR-NGROK-URL>` with the URL that you got from the previous step.\n```sh\nexport WEBHOOK_URL=<YOUR-NGROK-URL>\n```\n3. Follow the [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2) instructions to configure your credentials, using this URL as your **Redirect URL**."
