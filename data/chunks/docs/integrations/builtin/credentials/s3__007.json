  "content": "### Using DigitalOcean Spaces\n\nTo configure the credential for use with DigitalOcean spaces:\n\n1. In DigitalOceans, go to the control panel and open **Settings**. Your endpoint should be listed there. Prepend `https://` to that endpoint and enter it as the **S3 Endpoint** in n8n.\n    - Your DigitalOceans endpoint depends on the data center region your bucket's in.\n2. For the **Region**, enter the region your bucket's located in, for example, `nyc3`.\n    - If you plan to use this credential to create new Spaces, enter `us-east-1` instead.\n3. From your DigitalOceans control panel, go to [**API**](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/spaces).\n4. Open the **Spaces Keys** tab.\n5. Select **Generate New Key**.\n6. Enter a **Name** for your key, like `n8n integration` and select the checkmark.\n7. Copy the **Key** displayed next to the name and enter this as the **Access Key ID** in n8n.\n8. Copy the **Secret** value and enter this as the **Secret Access Key** in n8n.\n    - Refer to [Sharing Access to Buckets with Access Keys](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/manage-access/#access-keys) for more information on generating the key and secret.\n9. Keep the **Force Path Style** toggle turned off unless you want to use subdomain/virtual calling format.\n10. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:\n    - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.\n    - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.\n\nRefer to DigitalOcean's [Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/) for more information."
