Start a chat with the [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).\n2. Enter the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.\n3. The BotFather will ask you for a name and username for your new bot:\n    * The **name** is the bot's name displayed in contact details and elsewhere. You can change the bot name later.\n    * The **username** is a short name used in search, mentions, and t.me links. Use these guidelines when creating your username:\n        * Must be between 5 and 32 characters long.\n        * Not case sensitive.\n        * May only include Latin characters, numbers, and underscores.\n        * Must end in `bot`, like `tetris_bot` or `TetrisBot`.\n        * You can't change the username later.\n3. Copy the bot **token** the BotFather generates and add it as the **Access Token** in n8n.\n\nRefer to the [BotFather Create a new bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#creating-a-new-bot) for more information."
