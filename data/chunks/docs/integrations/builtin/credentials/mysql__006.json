An SSH tunnel lets un-encrypted traffic pass over an encrypted connection and enables authorized remote access to servers protected from outside connections by a firewall.\n\nTo set up your database connection credential:\n\n1. Enter your database's hostname as the **Host** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the hostname:\n\n    ```\n    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'hostname';\n    ```\n\n2. Enter your database's name as the **Database** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the database name:\n\n    ```\n    SHOW DATABASES;\n    ```\n\n3. Enter the username of a **User** in the database. This user should have appropriate permissions for whatever actions you want n8n to perform.\n4. Enter the **Password** for that user.\n5. Enter the **Port** number used by the MySQL server (default is `3306`). Run this query to confirm the port number:\n\n    ```\n    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'port';\n    ```\n\n6. Enter the **Connect Timeout** you'd like the node to use. The Connect Timeout is the number of milliseconds during the initial database connection the node should wait before timing out. n8n defaults to `10000` which is the default used by MySQL of 10 seconds. If you want to match your database's `connect_timeout`, run this query to get it, then multiply by 1000 before entering it in n8n:\n\n    ```\n    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'connect_timeout';\n    ```\n\n7. If your database uses SSL and you'd like to use **SSL** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. If you turn it on, enter the information from your MySQL SSL certificate in these fields:\n    1. Enter the `ca.pem` file contents in the **CA Certificate** field.\n    2. Enter the `client-key.pem` file contents in the **Client Private Key** field.\n    3. Enter the `client-cert.pem` file contents in the **Client Certificate** field.\n8. If you want to use **SSH Tunnel** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. Otherwise, skip it. If you turn it on:\n    1. Select the **SSH Authenticate with** to set the SSH Tunnel type to build:\n        - Select **Password** if you want to connect to SSH using a password.\n        - Select **Private Key** if you want to connect to SSH using an identity file (private key) and a passphrase. \n    2. Enter the **SSH Host**. n8n uses this host to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.\n    3. Enter the **SSH Port**. n8n uses this port to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.\n    4. Enter the **SSH User** to connect with. n8n uses this user to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.\n    5. If you selected **Password** for **SSH Authenticate with**, add the **SSH Password**.\n    6. If you selected **Private Key** for **SSH Authenticate with**:\n        1. Add the contents of the **Private Key** or identity file used for SSH. This is"
