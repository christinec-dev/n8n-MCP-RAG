Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the local server running on port `5678` to the internet. In your terminal, run the following command:\n```sh\nngrok http 5678\n```\n2. Run the following command in a new terminal. Replace `<YOUR-NGROK-URL>` with the URL that you get from the previous step.\n```sh\nexport WEBHOOK_URL=<YOUR-NGROK-URL>\n```\n3. Use the generated URL as your **OAuth 2 redirect URL** in Twist."
