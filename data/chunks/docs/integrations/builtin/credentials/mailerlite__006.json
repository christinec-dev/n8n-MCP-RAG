Refer to the [API Authentication documentation](https://developers.mailerlite.com/docs/#authentication) for more detailed instructions.\n\nEnable the **Classic API** toggle if the API key is for a MailerLite Classic account instead of the newer MailerLite experience.\n\n/// note\nMost new MailerLite accounts and all free accounts should disable the **Classic API** toggle. You can find out [which version of MailerLite you are using](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/which-version-of-mailerlite-am-i-using) and learn more about the differences between the two in the [MailerLite FAQ](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/new-mailerlite-faq).\n///"
