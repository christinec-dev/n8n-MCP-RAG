  "content": "## Using OAuth2\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **Client ID**: Generated when you create a new OAuth2 application.\n- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you create a new OAuth2 application.\n- Select the **Actor**: The actor defines how the OAuth2 application should create issues, comments and other changes. Options include:\n    - **User** (Linear's default): The application creates resources as the authorizing user. Use this option if you want each user to do their own authentication.\n    - **Application**: The application creates resources as itself. Use this option if you have only one user (like an admin) authorizing the application.\n- To use this credential with the [Linear Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.lineartrigger.md) node, you must enable the **Include Admin Scope** toggle.\n\nRefer to the [Linear OAuth2 Authentication documentation](https://developers.linear.app/docs/oauth/authentication) for more detailed instructions and explanations. Use the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** as the **Redirect callback URL** in your Linear OAuth2 application."
