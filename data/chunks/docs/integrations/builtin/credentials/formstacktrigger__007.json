For example `https://localhost:5678/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`.\n- **Platform**: Select **Website**.\n\nOnce you've created the application, select it from the applications list to view the **Application Details**. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and add them to n8n. Once you've added both, select the **Connect my account** button to begin the OAuth2 flow and authorization process.\n\nRefer to [Formstack's API Authorization documentation](https://developers.formstack.com/reference/api-overview#obtaining-an-api-key-oauth2-access-token) for more detailed instructions.\n\n/// note | Access token permissions\nFormstack ties access tokens to a Formstack user. Access tokens follow Formstack (in-app) user permissions.\n///"
