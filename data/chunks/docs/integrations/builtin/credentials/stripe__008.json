Each mode has its own API key. \n\nUse test mode to access simulated test data and live mode to access actual account data. Objects in one mode arenâ€™t accessible to the other.\n\nRefer to [API keys | Test mode versus live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes) for more information about what's available in each mode and guidance on when to use each.\n\n/// note | n8n credentials for both modes\nIf you want to work with both live mode and test mode keys, store each mode's key in a separate n8n credential.\n///"
