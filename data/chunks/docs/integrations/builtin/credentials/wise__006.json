Enter the generated API key in your n8n credential. Refer to [Getting started with the API](https://wise.com/help/articles/2958107/getting-started-with-the-api) for more information.\n- Your **Environment**: Select the environment that best matches your Wise account environment.\n    - If you're using a Wise test sandbox account, select **Test**.\n    - Otherwise, select **Live**.\n- **Private Key (Optional)**: For live endpoints requiring Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), generate a public and private key. Enter the private key here. Refer to [Add a private key](#add-a-private-key) for more information.\n    - If you're using a **Test** environment, you'll only need to enter a Private Key if you've enabled Strong Customer Authentication on the [public keys management page](https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/public-keys)."
