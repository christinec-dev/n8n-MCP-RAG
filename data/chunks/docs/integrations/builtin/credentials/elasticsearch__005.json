Enter your Elasticsearch **Username**.\n2. Enter your Elasticsearch **Password**.\n3. In Elasticsearch, go to **Deployments**.\n4. Select your deployment.\n5. Select **Manage this deployment**.\n6. In the **Applications** section, copy the endpoint of the **Elasticsearch** application.\n7. Enter this in n8n as the **Base URL**.\n8.
