Some providers call this the \"region slug.\"\n- An **Access Key ID**: Enter the S3 access key your S3 provider uses to access the bucket or space. Some providers call this API keys.\n- A **Secret Access Key**: Enter the secret access key for the **Access Key ID**.\n- **Force Path Style**: When turned on, the connection uses path-style addressing for buckets.\n- **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.\n\nMore detailed instructions for DigitalOcean Spaces and Wasabi follow. If you're using a different provider, refer to their documentation for more information."
