Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.\n2. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio.

The **Use cases** page opens.\n3. Select **Other**, then select **Next**.\n4. Select **Business** and **Next**.\n5.

Copy the **App Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** within your n8n credential.\n\nYour credential should successfully connect now, but you'll need to go through the steps to take your Meta app live before you can use it with the [Facebook Lead Ads trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookleadadstrigger.md). Here's a summary of what you'll need to do:\n\n1. In your Meta app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.\n1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app \"Live.\")\n1. Select **Save changes**.\n1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.\n1. Facebook Login for Business requires Advanced Access for `public_profile`. To add it, go to **App Review > Permissions and Features**.\n1. Search for `public_profile` and select **Request advanced access**.\n1. Complete the steps for [business verification](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-verified-for-business/).\n1. Use the [Lead Ads Testing Tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing) to trigger some demo form submissions and test your workflow.\n\nRefer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.\n\nFor more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types)."
