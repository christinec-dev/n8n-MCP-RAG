  "content": "### Optional: Add an App Secret\n\nFor added security, Meta recommends adding an **App Secret**. This signs all API calls with the `appsecret_proof` parameter. The app secret proof is a sha256 hash of your access token, using your app secret as the key.\n\nTo generate an App Secret:\n\n1. In Meta while viewing your app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.\n1. Select **Show** next to the **App secret** field.\n1. The page prompts you to re-enter your Facebook account credentials. Once you do so, Meta shows the App Secret.\n1. Highlight it to select it, copy it, and paste this into your n8n credential as the **App Secret**.\n1. **Save** your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to the [App Secret documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/security#appsecret) for more information."
