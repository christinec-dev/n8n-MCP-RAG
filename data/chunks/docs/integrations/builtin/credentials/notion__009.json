  "content": "## Internal vs. public integrations\n\n**Internal** integrations are:\n\n* Specific to a single workspace.\n* Accessible only to members of that workspace.\n* Ideal for custom workspace enhancements.\n\nInternal integrations use a simpler authentication process (the integration secret) and don't require any security review before publishing.\n\n**Public** integrations are:\n\n* Usable across multiple, unrelated Notion workspaces.\n* Accessible by any Notion user, regardless of their workspace.\n* Ideal for catering to broad use cases.\n\nPublic integrations use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. They require a Notion security review before publishing.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of the two integration types, refer to Notion's [Internal vs. Public Integrations documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started#internal-vs-public-integrations)."
