Go to **Features** > **Event Subscriptions**.\n2. Turn on the **Enable Events** control.\n3. In n8n, copy the **Webhook URL** and enter it as the **Request URL** in your Slack app.\n\n    ///  note  | Request URL\n    Slack only allows one request URL per app. If you want to test your workflow, you'll need to do one of the following:\n\n    - Test with your **Test URL** first, then change your Slack app to use the **Production URL** once you've verified everything's working\n    - Use the **Production URL** with execution logging.\n    ///\n\n4. Once verified, select the bot events to subscribe to. Use the **Trigger on** field in n8n to filter these requests. \n    - To use an event not in the list, add it as a bot event and select **Any Event** in the n8n node.\n\nRefer to [Quickstart | Configuring the app for event listening](https://api.slack.com/quickstart#listening) for more information."
