Log in to Mattermost as an admin.\n2. Go to **System Console > Integrations > Integration Management**.\n3. Confirm that **Enable personal access tokens** is set to **true**. If it's not, change.\n4. Go to **System Console > User Management > Users**.\n5. Search for the user account you want to allow to generate personal access tokens.\n6. Select the **Actions** dropdown for the user and select **Manage roles**.\n7. Check the box for **Allow this account to generate personal access tokens** and **Save**.\n\nRefer to the Mattermost [Personal access tokens documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token/) for more information."
