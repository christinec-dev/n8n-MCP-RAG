The n8n credential works with **Main** and **Standard** key types.\n\nHere are more details on the different API key types:\n\n* **Main**: This key type gives you the same level of access as using your Account SID and Auth Token in API requests.\n* **Standard**: This key type gives you access to all the functionality in Twilio's APIs except the API key resources and Account resources.\n* **Restricted**: This key type is in beta. n8n hasn't tested the credential against this key type; if you try it, let us know if you run into any issues.\n\nRefer to [Types of API keys](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api-keys#types-of-api-keys) for more information on the key types."
