  "content": "## Using OAuth2\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **Client ID**: Generated when you create a Pushbullet app, also known as an OAuth client.\n- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you create a Pushbullet app, also known as an OAuth client.\n\nTo generate the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, go to the [create client](https://www.pushbullet.com/create-client) page. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and add this as your **redirect_uri** for the app/client. Use the **client_id** and **client_secret** from the OAuth Client in your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to Pushbullet's [OAuth2 Guide](https://docs.pushbullet.com/#oauth2) for more information.\n\n/// note | Pushbullet OAuth test link\nPushbullet offers a test link during the client creation process described above. This link isn't compatible with n8n. To verify the authentication works, use the **Connect my account** button in n8n.\n///"
