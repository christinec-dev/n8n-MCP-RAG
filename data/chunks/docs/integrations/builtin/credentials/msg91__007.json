You can add them in one of two places, depending on your desired security level:\n\n- To allow any/all authkeys in the account to work with n8n, add the n8n IP addresses in the **Company's whitelisted IPs** section of the **Authkey** page.\n- To allow only specific authkeys to work with n8n, add the n8n IP addresses in the **Whitelisted IPs** section of an authkey's details."
