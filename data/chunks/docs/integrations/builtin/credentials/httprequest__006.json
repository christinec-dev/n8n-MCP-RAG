  "content": "## Using OAuth1\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth1 authentication.\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n- An **Authorization URL**: Also known as the Resource Owner Authorization URI. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/authorize`. The temporary credentials are sent here to prompt a user to complete authorization.\n- An **Access Token URL**: This is the URI used for the initial request for temporary credentials. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/request` or `/oauth1/token`.\n- A **Consumer Key**: Also known as the client key, like a username. This specifies the `oauth_consumer_key` to use for the call.\n- A **Consumer Secret**: Also known as the client secret, like a password.\n- A **Request Token URL**: This is the URI used to switch from temporary credentials to long-lived credentials after authorization. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/access`.\n- Select the **Signature Method** the auth handshake uses. This specifies the `oauth_signature_method` to use for the call. Options include:\n\t- **HMAC-SHA1**\n\t- **HMAC-SHA256**\n\t- **HMAC-SHA512**\n\nFor most OAuth1 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration to generate the values for most of these fields. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.\n\nRead more about [OAuth1](https://oauth.net/1/) and the [OAuth1 authorization flow](https://oauth1.wp-api.org/docs/basics/Auth-Flow.html)."
