If you don't have one already, create an app in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true).\n2. Enter a **Name** for your app.\n3. Select **Create**.\n4. Select **Bot** from the left menu.\n5. Under **Token**, select **Reset Token** to generate a new bot token. \n6. Copy the token and add it to your n8n credential.\n7. In **Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents**, add any privileged intents you want your bot to have. Refer to [Configuring your bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#configuring-your-bot) for more information on privileged intents.\n    - n8n recommends activating **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT: Required for your bot to receive events listed under GUILD_MEMBERS**. \n8. In **Installation > Installation Contexts**, select the installation contexts you want your bot to use:\n    - Select **Guild Install** for server-installed apps. (Most common for n8n users.)\n    - Select **User Install** for user-installed apps. (Less common for n8n users, but may be useful for testing.)\n    - Refer to Discord's [Choosing installation contexts](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#choosing-installation-contexts) documentation for more information about these installation contexts.\n9. In **Installation > Install Link**, select **Discord Provided Link** if it's not already selected.\n10. Still on the **Installation** page, in the **Default Install Settings** section, select `applications.commands` and `bot` scopes. Refer to Discord's [Scopes](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) documentation for more information about these and other scopes.\n11. Add permissions on the **Bot > Bot Permissions** page. Refer to Discord's [Permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions) documentation for more information. n8n recommends selecting these permissions for the [Discord](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/index.md) node:\n    - Manage Roles\n    - Manage Channels\n    - Read Messages/View Channels\n    - Send Messages\n    - Create Public Threads\n    - Create Private Threads\n    - Send Messages in Threads\n    - Send TTS Messages\n    - Manage Messages\n    - Manage Threads\n    - Embed Links\n    - Attach Files\n    - Read Message History\n    - Add Reactions\n12. Add the app to your server or test server:\n    1. Go to **Installation > Install Link** and copy the link listed there.\n    2. Paste the link in your browser and hit Enter.\n    1. Select **Add to server** in the installation prompt.\n    1. Once your app's added to your server, you'll see it in the member list.\n\nThese steps outline the basic functionality needed to set up your n8n credential. Refer to the [Discord Creating an App](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app) guide for more information on creating an app, especially:\n\n- [Fetching your credentials](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#fetching-your-credentials) for getting your app's credentials into your local developer environment.\n- [Handling interactivity](https://discord.com/developers/docs/"
