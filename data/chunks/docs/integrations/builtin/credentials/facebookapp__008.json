Select **Execute step** to shift the trigger into listening mode.\n6. Return to the tab or window where your Meta app's **Webhooks** product configuration is open.\n7. **Subscribe** to the objects you want to receive Facebook Trigger notifications about. For each subscription:\n    1. Copy the **Webhook URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Callback URL** in your Meta App.\n    1. Enter the **Access Token** you copied above as the **Verify token**.\n    1. Select **Verify and save**. (This step fails if you don't have your n8n trigger listening.)\n    1. Some webhook subscriptions, like **User**, prompt you to subscribe to individual events. Subscribe to the events you're interested in.\n    1. You can send some **Test** events from Meta to confirm things are working. If you send a test event, verify its receipt in n8n.\n\nRefer to the [Facebook Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/index.md) documentation for more information."
