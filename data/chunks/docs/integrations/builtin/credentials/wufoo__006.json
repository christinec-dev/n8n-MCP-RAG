To the right of a form, select **More > API Information**. Refer to [Using API Information and Webhooks](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/integrations/wufoo-api/) for more information.\n- A **Subdomain**: Your subdomain is the part of your Wufoo URL that comes after `https://` and before `wufoo.com`. So if the full domain is `https://n8n.wufoo.com`, the subdomain is `n8n`. Admins can view the subdomain in the [**Account Manager**](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/account-manager). Refer to [Your Subdomain](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/account/your-subdomain/) for more information."
