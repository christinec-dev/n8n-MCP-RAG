  "content": "## Using API access token\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need to [Install](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) Home Assistant, create a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/onboarding) account, and have:\n\n- Your **Host**\n- The **Port**\n- A Long-Lived **Access Token**\n\nTo generate an access token and set up the credential:\n\n1. To generate your **Access Token**, log in to Home Assistant and open your [User profile](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile).\n2. In the **Long-Lived Access Tokens** section, generate a new token.\n3. Copy this token and enter it in n8n as your **Access Token**.\n4. Enter the URL or IP address of your Home Assistant **Host**, without the `http://` or `https://` protocol, for example `your.awesome.home`.\n5. For the **Port**, enter the appropriate port:\n\t- If you've made no port changes and access Home Assistant at `http://`, keep the default of `8123`.\n\t- If you've made no port changes and access Home Assistant at `https://`, enter `443`.\n\t- If you've configured Home Assistant to use a specific port, enter that port.\n6. If you've enabled SSL in Home Assistant in the [config.yml map key](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/configuration/?_highlight=ssl#add-on-configuration), turn on the **SSL** toggle in n8n. If you're not sure, it's best to turn this setting on if you access your home assistant UI using `https://` instead of `http://`."
