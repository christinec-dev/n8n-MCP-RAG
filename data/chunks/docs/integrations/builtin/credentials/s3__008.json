For the **Region**, enter the region slug portion of the service URL. For example, if you entered `https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com` as the **S3 Endpoint**, `us-east-2` is the region.\n3.

Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:\n    - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.\n    - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**."
