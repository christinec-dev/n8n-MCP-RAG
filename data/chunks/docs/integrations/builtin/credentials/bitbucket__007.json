The n8n credentials dialog will throw an error if the user account lacks the appropriate permissions for the selected scope, like `Your credentials lack one or more required privilege scopes`.\n\nSee the [Bitbucket App password permissions documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-password-permissions/) for more information on working with these permissions."
