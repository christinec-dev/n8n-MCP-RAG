Refer to [Rate limits](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) for the access plan level rate limits and guidance on avoiding hitting them.\n\nUse the guidance below for calculating rate limits:\n\n- If you're using the deprecated OAuth method, user rate limits apply. You'll have one limit per time window for each set of users' access tokens.\n- If you're [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2), app rate limits apply. You'll have a limit per time window for requests made by your app.\n\nX calculates user rate limits and app rate limits independently.\n\nRefer to X's [Rate limits and authentication methods](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits#auth) for more information about these rate limit types."
