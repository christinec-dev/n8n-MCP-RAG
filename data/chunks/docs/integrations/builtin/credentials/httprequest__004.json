It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.\n\nYou can use [Predefined credential types](/integrations/custom-operations.md#predefined-credential-types) to perform custom operations with some APIs where n8n has a node for the platform. For example, n8n has an Asana node, and supports using your Asana credentials in the HTTP Request node. Refer to [Custom operations](/integrations/custom-operations.md) for more information.\n///"
