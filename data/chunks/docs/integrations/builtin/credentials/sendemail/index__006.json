  "content": "## Using SMTP account\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **User** email address\n- A **Password**: This may be the user's password or an app password. Refer to the documentation for your email provider.\n- The **Host**: The SMTP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `smtp.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.\n- A **Port** number: The default is port `465`, commonly used for SSL. Other common ports are `587` for TLS or `25` for no encryption. Check with your provider.\n- **SSL/TLS**: When turned on, SMTP will use SSL/TLS.\n- **Disable STARTTLS**: When SSL/TLS is disabled, the SMTP server can still try to [upgrade the TCP connection using STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS). Turning this on prevents that behaviour.\n- **Client Host Name**: If needed by your provider, add a client host name. This name identifies the client to the server."
