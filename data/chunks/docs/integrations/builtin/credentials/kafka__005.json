Enter the `CLIENT-ID` of the client or consumer group in the **Client ID** field in your credential.\n2. Enter a comma-separated list of relevant **Brokers** for the credential to use in the format `<broker-service-name>:<port>`. Use the name you gave the broker when you defined it in the `services` list. For example, `kafka-1:9092,kafka-2:9092` would add the brokers `kafka-1` and `kafka-2` on port `9092`.\n3. If your Kafka environment doesn't use SSL, turn off the **SSL** toggle.\n4. If you've enabled authentication using SASL in your Kafka environment, turn on the **Authentication** toggle. Then add:\n    1. The **Username**\n    2. The **Password**\n    3. Select the broker's configured **SASL Mechanism**. Refer to [SASL configuration](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_config) for more information. Options include:\n        - `Plain`\n        - `scram-sha-256`\n        - `scram-sha-512`"
