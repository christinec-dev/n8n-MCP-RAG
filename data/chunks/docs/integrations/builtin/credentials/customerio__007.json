  "content": "## Why you need a Tracking API Key and an App API Key\n\nCustomer.io has two different API endpoints and generates and stores the keys for each slightly differently:\n\n- The [Track API](https://customer.io/docs/api/track/) at `https://track.customer.io/api/v1/`\n- The [App API](https://customer.io/docs/api/app/) at `https://api.customer.io/v1/api/`\n\nThe Track API requires a Tracking Site ID; the App API doesn't.\n\nBased on the operation you want to perform, n8n uses the correct API key and its corresponding endpoint."
