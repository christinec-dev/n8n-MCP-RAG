  "content": "* **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.\n\t\t* **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.\n\n#### On Webhook Call options\n\n* **Binary Property**: Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to. This option's only relevant if binary data is received.\n* **Ignore Bots**: Set whether to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers (turned on) or not (turned off).\n* **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enter IP addresses here to limit who (or what) can invoke the webhook URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook URL.\n* **No Response Body**: Set whether n8n should send a body in the response (turned off) or prevent n8n from sending a body in the response (turned on).\n* **Raw Body**: Set whether to return the body in a raw format like JSON or XML (turned on) or not (turned off).\n* **Response Data**: Enter any custom data you want to send in the response.\n* **Response Headers**: Send more headers in the webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) to learn more about response headers.\n* **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.\n\n#### On Webhook Call limitations\n\nThere are some limitations to keep in mind when using On Webhook Call:\n\n* Partial executions of your workflow changes the `$resumeWebhookUrl`, so be sure that the node sending this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node."
