Refer to sections below for examples of running [multiple commands](#run-multiple-commands) and [cURL commands](#run-curl-command).\n\n#### Run multiple commands\n\nUse one of two methods to run multiple commands in one Execute Command node:\n\n* Enter each command on one line separated by `&&`. For example, you can combine the change directory (cd) command with the list (ls) command using `&&`.\n\n    ```bash\n    cd bin && ls\n    ```\n\n* Enter each command on a separate line. For example, you can write the list (ls) command on a new line after the change directory (cd) command.\n\n    ```bash\n    cd bin\n    ls\n    ```\n\n#### Run cURL command\n\nYou can also use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node to make a cURL request.\n\nIf you want to run the curl command in the Execute Command node, you will have to build a Docker image based on the existing n8n image. The default n8n Docker image uses Alpine Linux. You will have to install the curl package.\n\n1. Create a file named `Dockerfile`.\n2. Add the below code snippet to the Dockerfile.\n\n    ```shell\n    FROM docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n\n    USER root\n    RUN apk --update add curl\n    USER node\n    ```\n\n3. In the same folder, execute the command below to build the Docker image.\n\n    ```shell\n    docker build -t n8n-curl\n    ```\n\n4. Replace the Docker image you used before. For example, replace `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` with `n8n-curl`.\n5. Run the newly created Docker image. You'll now be able to execute ssh using the Execute Command Node."
