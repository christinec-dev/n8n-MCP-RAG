If your command isn't included in the container, you might have to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/) that includes your command.\n\t* If n8n is already running:\n\t\t```sh\n\t\t# Find n8n's container ID, it will be the first column\n\t\tdocker ps | grep n8n\n\t\t# Try to execute the command within the running container\n\t\tdocker container exec <container_ID> <command_to_run>\n\t\t```\n\t* If n8n isn't running:\n\t\t```sh\n\t\t# Start up a new container that runs the command instead of n8n\n\t\t# Use the same image and tag that you use to run n8n normally\n\t\tdocker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n -c <command_to_run>\n\t\t```\n\n<!-- vale off -->"
