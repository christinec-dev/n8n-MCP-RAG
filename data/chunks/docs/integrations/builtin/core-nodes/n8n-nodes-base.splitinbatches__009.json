  "content": "### Read RSS feed from two different sources\n\nThis workflow allows you to read an RSS feed from two different sources using the Loop Over Items node. You need the Loop Over Items node in the workflow as the RSS Feed Read node only processes the first item it receives. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/687-read-rss-feed-from-two-different-sources/) on n8n.io.\n\nThe example walks through building the workflow, but assumes you are already familiar with n8n. To build your first workflow, including learning how to add nodes to a workflow, refer to [Try it out](/try-it-out/index.md).\n\nThe final workflow looks like this:\n\n[[ workflowDemo(\"file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/rss-feed-example.json\") ]]\n\nCopy the workflow file above and paste into your instance, or manually build it by following these steps:\n\n1. Add the manual trigger.\n2. Add the Code node.\n3. Copy this code into the Code node:\n\t```js\n\treturn [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tjson: {\n\t\t\t\turl: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io',\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tjson: {\n\t\t\t\turl: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n',\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t];\n\t```\n4. Add the Loop Over Items node.\n5. Configure Loop Over Items: set the batch size to `1` in the **Batch Size** field.\n6. Add the RSS Feed Read node.\n7. Select **Execute Workflow**. This runs the workflow to load data into the RSS Feed Read node.\n8. Configure RSS Feed Read: map `url` from the input to the **URL** field. You can do this by dragging and dropping from the **INPUT** panel, or using this expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.\n9. Select **Execute Workflow** to run the workflow and see the resulting data."
