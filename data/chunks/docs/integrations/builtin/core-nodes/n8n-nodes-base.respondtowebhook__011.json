  "content": "## Return more than one data item (deprecated)\n\n/// note | Deprecated in 1.22.0\nn8n 1.22.0 added support for returning all data items using the **All Incoming Items** option. n8n recommends upgrading to the latest version of n8n, instead of using the workarounds described in this section.\n///\n\nThe Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. This includes when using [expressions](/code/expressions.md). You can't force looping using the Loop node: the workflow will run, but the webhook response will still only contain the results of the first execution.\n\nIf you need to return more than one data item, choose one of these options:\n\n- Instead of using the Respond to Webhook node, use the **When Last Node Finishes** option in **Respond** in the Webhook node. Use this when you want to return the final data that the workflow outputs.\n- Use the [Aggregate](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate.md) node to turn multiple items into a single item before passing the data to the Respond to Webhook node. Set **Aggregate** to **All Item Data (Into a Single List)**."
