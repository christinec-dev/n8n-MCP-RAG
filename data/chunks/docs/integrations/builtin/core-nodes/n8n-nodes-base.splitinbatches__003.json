  "content": "## When to use the Loop Over Items node\n\nBy default, n8n nodes are designed to process a list of input items (with some exceptions, detailed below). Depending on what you're trying to achieve, you often don't need the Loop Over Items node in your workflow. You can learn more about how n8n processes multiple items on the [looping in n8n](/flow-logic/looping.md) page.\n\nThese links highlight some of the cases where the Loop Over Items node can be useful:\n\n* [Loop until all items are processed](/flow-logic/looping.md#loop-until-all-items-are-processed): describes how the Loop Over Items node differs from normal item processing and when you might want to incorporate this node.\n* [Node exceptions](/flow-logic/looping.md#node-exceptions): outlines specific cases and nodes where you may need to use the Loop Over Items node to manually build looping logic.\n* [Avoiding rate limiting](/integrations/builtin/rate-limits.md): demonstrates how to batch API requests to avoid rate limits from other services."
