  "content": "### MCP URL\n\nThe MCP Server Trigger node has two **MCP URLs**: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.\n\nSelect **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.\n\n* **Test**: n8n registers a test MCP URL when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Execute workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the MCP URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.\n* **Production**: n8n registers a production MCP URL when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view."
