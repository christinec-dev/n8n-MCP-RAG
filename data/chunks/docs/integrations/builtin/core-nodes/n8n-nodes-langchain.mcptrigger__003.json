  "content": "## How the MCP Server Trigger node works\n\nThe MCP Server Trigger node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools.\n\nUnlike conventional [trigger nodes](/glossary.md#trigger-node-n8n), which respond to events and pass their output to the next [connected node](/workflows/components/connections.md), the MCP Server Trigger node only connects to and executes [tool](/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools.md) nodes. Clients can list the available tools and call individual tools to perform work.\n\nYou can expose n8n workflows to clients by attaching them with the [Custom n8n Workflow Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow.md) node.\n\n/// note | Server-Sent Events (SSE) and streamable HTTP support\nThe MCP Server Trigger node supports both [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse), a long-lived transport built on top of HTTP, and [streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) for connections between clients and the server. It currently doesn't support [standard input/output (stdio)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#standard-input%2Foutput-stdio) transport.\n///"
