It should be the first node in the workflow.\n\nn8n allows you to call workflows from other workflows. This is useful if you want to:\n\n* Reuse a workflow: for example, you could have multiple workflows pulling and processing data from different sources, then have all those workflows call a single workflow that generates a report.\n* Break large workflows into smaller components."
