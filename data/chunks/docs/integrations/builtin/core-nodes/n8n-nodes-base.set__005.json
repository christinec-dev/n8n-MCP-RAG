Hover over a field. n8n displays the **Fixed | Expressions** toggle. \n1. Select **Fixed**.\n\nYou can do this for both the name and value of the field.\n\n![A gif showing the drag and drop action, as well as changing a field to fixed](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/set/drag-drop-fixed-toggle.gif)"
