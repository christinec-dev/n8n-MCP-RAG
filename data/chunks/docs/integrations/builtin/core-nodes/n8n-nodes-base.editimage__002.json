If you aren't running n8n on Docker, you need to install [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/README.html).\n2. You need to use a node such as the [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile.md) node or the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node to pass the image file as a data property to the Edit Image node.\n///"
