You can use the Evaluation node to conditionally execute logic based on whether the workflow is under evaluation, to write evaluation outcomes back to a Google Sheet dataset, or to log scoring metrics for your evaluation performance to n8n's evaluations tab.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nThe Evaluation node's **Set Outputs** operation uses Google Sheets to record evaluation outcomes. To use that operation, you must configure a [Google Sheets credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/index.md).\n///"
