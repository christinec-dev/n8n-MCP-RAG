You can use these characters to define a path pattern:\n\t\t- `*`: Matches any character zero or more times, excluding path separators.\n\t\t- `**`: Matches any character zero or more times, include path separators.\n\t\t- `?`: Matches any character except for path separators one time.\n\t\t- `[]`: Matches any characters inside the brackets. For example, `[abc]` would match the characters `a`, `b`, or `c`, and nothing else.\n\nRefer to [Picomatch's Basic globbing](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#basic-globbing) documentation for more information on these characters and their expected behavior."
