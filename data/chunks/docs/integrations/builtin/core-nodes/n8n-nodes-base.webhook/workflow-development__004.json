You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when an external service calls the webhook URL.\n\nWhen working with a Production webhook, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the webhook isn't visible in the editor UI with the production webhook.\n\nRefer to [Create a workflow](/workflows/create.md) for more information on activating workflows."
