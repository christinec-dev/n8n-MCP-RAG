Select **Listen for test event** to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.\n\nWhen using the Webhook node on localhost on a [self-hosted](/hosting/index.md) n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:\n\n* [npm with tunnel](/hosting/installation/npm.md#n8n-with-tunnel)\n* [Docker with tunnel](/hosting/installation/docker.md#n8n-with-tunnel)\n\n<video src=\"/_video/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-node-intro.mp4\" controls width=\"100%\"></video>"
