  "content": "# Webhook node\n\nUse the Webhook node to create [webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook), which can receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow.\n\nYou can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for building a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint.\n\nThe webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node."
