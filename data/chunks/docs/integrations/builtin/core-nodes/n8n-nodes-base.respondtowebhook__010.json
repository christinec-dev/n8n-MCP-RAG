To enable this secondary output, open the Respond to Webhook node on the canvas and select the **Settings** tab. Activate the **Enable Response Output Branch** option.\n\nThe node will now have two outputs:\n\n* **Input Data**: The original output, passing on the node's input.\n* **Response**: The response object sent to the webhook."
