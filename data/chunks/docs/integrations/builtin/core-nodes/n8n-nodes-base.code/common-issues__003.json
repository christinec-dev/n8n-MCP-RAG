Each of these objects wraps another object with the `json` key:\n\n```javascript\n[\n  {\n    \"json\": {\n\t  // your data goes here\n\t}\n  }\n]\n```\n\nTo troubleshoot this error, check the following:\n\n* Read the [data structure](/data/data-structure.md) to understand the data you receive in the Code node and the requirements for outputting data from the node.\n* Understand how data items work and how to connect data items from previous nodes with [item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/index.md).\n\n<!-- vale off -->"
