  "content": "## Using global variables\n\nSometimes you may wish to set and retrieve simple global data related to a workflow across and within executions. For example, you may wish to include the date of the previous report when compiling a report with a list of project updates.\n\nTo set, update, and retrieve data directly to a workflow, use the [static data](/code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data.md) functions within your code. You can manage data either globally or tied to specific nodes.\n\n/// info | Use Remove Duplicates when possible\nIf you're interested in using variables to avoid processing the same data items more than once, consider using the [Remove Duplicates node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/index.md) instead. The Remove Duplicates node can save information across executions to avoid processing the same items multiple times.\n///"
