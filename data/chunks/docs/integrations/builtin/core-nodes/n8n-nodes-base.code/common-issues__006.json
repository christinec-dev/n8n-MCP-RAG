These aren't supported by n8n's JavaScript sandbox. Instead, use the `require` function to load modules.\n\nTo resolve this issue, try changing your `import` statements to use `require`:\n\n```javascript\n// Original code:\n// import express from \"express\";\n// New code:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\n```\n\n<!-- vale off -->"
