  "content": "# Remove Duplicates node\n\nUse the Remove Duplicates node to identify and delete items that are:\n\n* identical across all fields or a subset of fields in a single execution\n* identical to or surpassed by items seen in previous executions\n\nThis is helpful in situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items.\n\nBy comparing against data from previous executions, the Remove Duplicates node can  delete items seen in earlier executions. It can also ensure that new items have a later date or a higher value than previous values.\n\n/// note | Major changes in 1.64.0\nThe n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 1.64.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/7a66308290e6e5b104fcb82a3beafa0d6987df36/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates.md).\n///"
