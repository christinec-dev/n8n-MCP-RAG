This is useful when you want to pass extra data to the form that doesn't require interactive user input.\n\nTo add fields that won't show up on the form, use the **Hidden Field** form element. There, you can define the **Field Name** and optionally provide a default value by filling out the **Field Value**.\n\nWhen serving the form, you can pass values for hidden fields using [query parameters](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters)."
