In **Input B Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B. \n2. **Optional**: You can compare by multiple fields. Select **Add Fields to Match** to set up more comparisons.\n3. Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In **When There Are Differences**, select one of the following:\n\t* **Use Input A Version** to treat input stream A as the source of truth.\n\t* **Use Input B Version** to treat input stream B as the source of truth.\n\t* **Use a Mix of Versions** to use different inputs for different fields.\n\t\t* Use **Prefer** to select either **Input A Version** or **Input B Version** as the main source of truth.\n\t\t* Enter input fields that are exceptions to **For Everything Except** to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.\n\t* **Include Both Versions** to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.\n4. Decide whether to use **Fuzzy Compare**. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string `3` are treated as the same with **Fuzzy Compare** turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off."
