This allows you to have multiple chat interactions within a single execution and enables human-in-the-loop use cases in the chat.\n\n/// note | Chat Trigger node\nThe Respond to Chat node requires a [Chat Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/index.md) node to be present in the workflow, with the [Response Mode](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/index.md#response-mode) set to 'Using Response Nodes'.\n///"
