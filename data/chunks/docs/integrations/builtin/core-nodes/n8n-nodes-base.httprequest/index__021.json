  "content": "### Optimize Response\n\nWhether to optimize the tool response to reduce the amount of data passed to the LLM. Optimizing the response can reduce costs and can help the LLM ignore unimportant details, often leading to better results.\n\nWhen optimizing responses, you select an expected response type, which determines other options you can configure. The supported response types are:\n\n#### JSON\n\nWhen expecting a **JSON** response, you can configure which parts of the JSON data to use as a response with the following choices:\n\n* **Field Containing Data**: This field identifies a specific part of the JSON object that contains your relevant data. You can leave this blank to use the entire response.\n* **Include Fields**: This is how you choose which fields you want in your response object. There are three choices:\n\t* **All**: Include all fields in the response object.\n\t* **Selected**: Include only the fields specified below.\n\t\t* **Fields**: A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.\n\t* **Exclude**: Include all fields *except* the fields specified below.\n\t\t* **Fields**: A comma-separated list of fields to exclude from the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.\n\n#### HTML\n\nWhen expecting **HTML**, you can identify the part of an HTML document relevant to the LLM and optimize the response with the following options:\n\n* **Selector (CSS)**: A specific element or element type to include in the response HTML. Uses the `body` element by default.\n* **Return Only Content**: Whether to strip HTML tags and attributes from the response, leaving only the actual content. This uses fewer tokens and may be easier for the model to understand.\n\t* **Elements To Omit**: A comma-separated list of CSS selectors to exclude when extracting content.\n* **Truncate Response**: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.\n\t* **Max Response Characters**: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.\n\n#### Text\n\nWhen expecting a generic **Text** response, you can optimize the results with the following options:\n\n* **Truncate Response**: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.\n\t* **Max Response Characters**: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000."
