If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.\n\nImport a curl command:\n\n1. From the HTTP Request node's **Parameters** tab, select **Import cURL**. The **Import cURL command** modal opens.\n2. Paste your curl command into the text box.\n3. Select **Import**. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration."
