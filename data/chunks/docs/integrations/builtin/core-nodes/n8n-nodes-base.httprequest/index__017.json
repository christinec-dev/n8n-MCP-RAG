Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.\n///\n??? Details \"Understand pagination\"\n    Pagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.\n  \n    For example, you make an API call to an endpoint called `/users`. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response. \n  \n    If the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call `/users` with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.\n\nConfigure the pagination settings:\n\n* **Pagination Mode**:\n    * **Off**: Turn off pagination.\n    * **Update a Parameter in Each Request**: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.\n    * **Response Contains Next URL**: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set **Next URL**.\n\nFor example setups, refer to [HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination](/code/cookbook/http-node/pagination.md).\n\nn8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/http/pagination-variables.md\"\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/http/pagination-api-differences.md\""
