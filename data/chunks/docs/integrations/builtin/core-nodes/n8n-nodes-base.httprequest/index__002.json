You can use the HTTP Request node a regular node or attached to an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent.md) to use as a [tool](/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools.md){ data-preview }.\n\nWhen using this node, you're creating a REST API call. You need some understanding of basic API terminology and concepts.\n\nThere are two ways to create an HTTP request: configure the [node parameters](#node-parameters) or [import a curl command](#import-curl-command).\n\n/// note | Credentials\nRefer to [HTTP Request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md) for guidance on setting up authentication. \n///"
