For more details, check out the entry in the [breaking changes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#01170) page.\n///\n\n/// note | Keep in mind\nIf you want to use the Activation Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.\n///\n\nThe Activation Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Activation Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow."
