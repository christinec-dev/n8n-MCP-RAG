Select an option in **Combine By** to determine how you want to merge the input data.\n\n#### Matching Fields\n\nCompare items by field values. Enter the fields you want to compare in **Fields to Match**. \n\nn8n's default behavior is to keep matching items. You can change this using the **Output Type** setting:\n\n* **Keep Matches**: Merge items that match. This is like an inner join.\n* **Keep Non-Matches**: Merge items that don't match.\n* **Keep Everything**: Merge items together that do match and include items that don't match. This is like an outer join.\n* **Enrich Input 1**: Keep all data from Input 1, and add matching data from Input 2. This is like a left join.\n* **Enrich Input 2**: Keep all data from Input 2, and add matching data from Input 1. This is like a right join.\n\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left.

The item at index 0 in Input 1 merges with the item at index 0 in Input 2, and so on.\n\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left.

The final data source combines these data sources by all possible combinations.](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/multiplex-diagram.png)\n<figcaption>Combine by All Possible Combinations mode inputs and output</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n#### Combine mode options\n\nWhen merging data by **Mode > Combine**, you can set these **Options**:\n\n* **Clash Handling**: Choose how to merge when data streams clash, or when there are sub-fields. Refer to [Clash handling](#clash-handling) for details.\n* **Fuzzy Compare**: Whether to tolerate type differences when comparing fields (enabled), or not (disabled, default). For example, when you enable this, n8n treats `\"3\"` and `3` as the same.\n* **Disable Dot Notation**: This prevents accessing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name.\n* **Multiple Matches**: Choose how n8n handles multiple matches when comparing data streams.\n    * **Include All Matches**: Output multiple items if there are multiple matches, one for each match.\n    * **Include First Match Only**: Keep the first item per match and discard the remaining multiple matches.\n* **Include Any Unpaired Items**: Choose whether to keep or discard unpaired items when merging by position. The default behavior is to leave out the items without a match. \n\n##### Clash Handling\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/field-value-clash.md\""
