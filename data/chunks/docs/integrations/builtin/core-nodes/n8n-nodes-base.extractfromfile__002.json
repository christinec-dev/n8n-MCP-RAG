  "content": "# Extract From File\n\nA common pattern in n8n workflows is to receive a file, either from and [HTTP Request node][] (for files you are fetching from a website), a [Webhook Node][] (for files which are sent to your workflow from elsewhere), or from a local source. Data obtained in this way is often in a binary format, for example a spreadsheet or PDF.\n\nThe Extract From File node extracts data from a binary format file and converts it to JSON, which can then be easily manipulated by the rest of your workflow. For converting JSON back into a binary file type, please see the [Convert to File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile.md) node."
