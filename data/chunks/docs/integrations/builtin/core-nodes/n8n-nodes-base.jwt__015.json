  "content": "### Verify node options\n\nThis operation includes several node options:\n\n* **Return Additional Info**: This toggle controls how much information the node returns. When turned on, the node returns the complete decoded token with information about the header and signature. When turned off, the node only returns the payload.\n* **Ignore Expiration**: This toggle controls whether the node should ignore the token's expiration time claim (`exp`). Refer to [\"exp\" (Expiration Time) Claim](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4) for more information.\n* **Ignore Not Before Claim**: This toggle controls whether to ignore the token's not before claim (`nbf`). Refer to [\"nbf\" (Not Before) Claim](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.5) for more information.\n* **Clock Tolerance**: Enter the number of seconds to tolerate when checking the `nbf` and `exp` claims. This allows you to deal with small clock differences among different servers. Refer to [\"exp\" (Expiration Time) Claim](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4) for more information.\n* **Override Algorithm**: The algorithm to use for verifying the token. This algorithm will override the algorithm selected in the credentials."
