When building forms with n8n, to avoid confusion, it's important to understand how forms behave when branching occurs.\n\n#### Workflows with mutually exclusive branches\n\nForm workflows containing mutually exclusive branches work as expected. n8n will execute a single branch according to the submitted data and conditions you outline. As it executes, n8n will display each page in the branch, ending with an n8n Form node with the **Form Ending** page type.\n\nThis workflow demonstrates mutually exclusive branching. Each selection can only execute a single branch.\n\n[[ workflowDemo(\"file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json\") ]]\n\n#### Workflows that may execute multiple branches\n\nForm workflows that send data to multiple branches at the same time require more care. When multiple branches receive data during an execution (for example, from a [switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch.md) node), n8n executes each branch that receives data [sequentially](/flow-logic/execution-order.md). Upon reaching the end of one branch, the execution will move to the next branch with data.\n\nn8n only executes a single **Form Ending** n8n Form node for each execution. When multiple branches of a form workflow receive data, n8n ignores all Form Ending nodes except for the one associated with the final branch.\n\nThis workflow may execute more than one branch during an execution. Here, n8n executes all valid branches sequentially. This impacts which n8n Form nodes n8n executes (in particular, which **Form Ending** node displays):\n\n[[ workflowDemo(\"file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/multiple-branch-execution.json\") ]]"
