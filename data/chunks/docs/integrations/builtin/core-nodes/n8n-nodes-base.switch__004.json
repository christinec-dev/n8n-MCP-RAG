For example, to create a rules for dates after a particular date, select **Date & Time > is after**.\n    * The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to [Available data type comparisons](#available-data-type-comparisons) for a full list of all comparisons by data type.\n* **Rename Output**: Turn this control on to rename the output field to put matching data into. Enter your desired **Output Name**.\n\nSelect **Add Routing Rule** to add more rules.\n\n#### Rule options\n\nYou can further configure the node with this operation using these **Options**:\n\n- **Fallback Output**: Choose how to route the workflow when an item doesn't match any of the rules or conditions.\n    - **None**: Ignore the item. This is the default behavior.\n    - **Extra Output**: Send items to an extra, separate output.\n    - **Output 0**: Send items to the same output as those matching the first rule.\n- **Ignore Case**: Set whether to ignore letter case when evaluating conditions (turned on) or enforce letter case (turned off).\n- **Less Strict Type Validation**: Set whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off).\n- **Send data to all matching outputs**: Set whether to send data to all outputs meeting conditions (turned on) or whether to send the data to the first output matching the conditions (turned off)."
