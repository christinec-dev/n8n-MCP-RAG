Some tips on using this option:\n\n* Use the [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile.md) node or the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node to upload the file to your workflow.\n* Add multiple attachments by entering a comma-separated list of binary properties.\n* Reference embedded images or other content within the body of an email message, for example `<img src=\"cid:image_1\">`."
