  "content": "### Displaying custom HTML\n\nYou can display custom HTML on your form by adding a **Custom HTML** field to your form. This provides an **HTML** box where you can insert arbitrary HTML code to display as part of the form page.\n\nYou can use the HTML field to enrich your form page by including things like links, images, videos, and more. n8n will render the content with the rest of the form fields in the normal document flow.\n\nBecause custom HTML content is read-only, these fields aren't included in the form output data by default. To include the raw HTML content in the node output, provide a name for the data using the **Element Name** field.\n\nThe HTML field doesn't support `<script>`, `<style>`, or `<input>` elements."
