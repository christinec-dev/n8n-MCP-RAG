The Wait node provides the `$execution.resumeUrl` variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email. \n\nWhen the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the `$execution.resumeUrl`. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially.\n\nFor this **Resume** style, set more parameters listed below.\n\n#### Authentication\n\nSelect if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to `$execution.resumeUrl` should be authenticated. Options include:\n\n* **Basic Auth**: Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Basic Auth** to use.\n* **Header Auth**: Use header authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Header Auth** to use.\n* **JWT Auth**: Use JWT authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for JWT Auth** to use.\n* **None**: Don't use authentication.\n\n/// note | Auth reference\nRefer to the [Webhook node | Authentication documentation](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/index.md#supported-authentication-methods) for more information on each auth type.\n///\n\n#### HTTP Method\n\nSelect the HTTP method the webhook should use. Refer to the [Webhook node | HTTP Method documentation](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/index.md#http-method) for more information.\n\n#### Response Code\n\nEnter the Response Code the webhook should return. You can use common codes or enter a custom code.\n\n#### Respond\n\nSet when and how to respond to the webhook from these options:\n\n* **Immediately**: Respond as soon as the node executes.\n* **When Last Node Finishes**: Return the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow. If you select this option, also set:\n\t* **Response Data**: Select what data should be returned and what format to use. Options include:\n\t\t* **All Entries**: Returns all the entries of the last node in an array.\n\t\t* **First Entry JSON**: Return the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.\n\t\t* **First Entry Binary**: Return the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.\n\t\t* **No Response Body**: Return with no body.\n* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook.md) node.\n\n#### Limit Wait Time\n\nSet whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off). If turned on, also set:\n\n* **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:\n\t* **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.\n\t\t* Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.\n\t\t* Select the limit's **Unit** of time.\n\t* **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.\n\t\t* **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.\n\n#### On Webhook Call options\n\n* **Binary Property**: Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to. This option's only relevant if binary data is received.\n* **Ignore Bots**: Set whether to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers (turned on) or not (turned off).\n* **IP(s) Whit"
