  "content": "### Form URLs\n\nThe Form Trigger node has two URLs: **Test URL** and **Production URL**. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.\n\n![Screenshot of the form URLs](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/form-trigger/form-urls.png)\n\n- **Test URL**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Execute Step** or **Execute Workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.\n- **Production URL**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution. Select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view."
