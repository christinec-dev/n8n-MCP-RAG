  "content": "## How n8n secures HTML responses\n\nStarting with [n8n version 1.103.0](/release-notes.md#n8n11030), n8n automatically wraps HTML responses to webhooks in `<iframe>` tags. This is a security mechanism to protect the instance users.\n\nThis has the following implications:\n\n- HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe instead of directly in the parent document.\n- JavaScript code that attempts to access the top-level window or local storage will fail.\n- Authentication headers aren't available in the sandboxed iframe (for example, basic auth). You need to use an alternative approach, like embedding a short-lived access token within the HTML.\n- Relative URLs (for example, `<form action=\"/\">`) won't work. Use absolute URLs instead."
