This may mean that there is a mistake in your cron expression or that you're using an incompatible syntax.\n\nTo debug, check that the following:\n\n* That your cron expression follows the syntax used in the [cron examples](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md#custom-cron-interval)\n* That your cron expression (after removing the [seconds column](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md#why-there-are-six-asterisks-in-the-cron-expression)) validates on [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/)"
