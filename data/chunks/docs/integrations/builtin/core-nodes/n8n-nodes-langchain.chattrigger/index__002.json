You can configure how users access the chat, using one of n8n's provided interfaces, or your own. You can add authentication.\n\nYou must connect either an agent or chain [root node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/index.md).\n\n/// warning | Workflow execution usage\nEvery message to the Chat Trigger executes your workflow. This means that one conversation where a user sends 10 messages uses 10 executions from your execution allowance. Check your payment plan for details of your allowance.\n///\n\n/// note | Manual Chat trigger\nThis node replaces the Manual Chat Trigger node from version 1.24.0.\n///"
