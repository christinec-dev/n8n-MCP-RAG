Instead, you want to take the output of an Agent or Chain node and modify it or do something else with it before sending it back to the user.\n\nIn a basic workflow, the Agent and Chain nodes output a parameter named either `output` or `text`, and the Chat trigger sends the value of this parameter to the user as the chat response. \n\nIf you need to manually create the response sent to the user, you must create a parameter named either `text` or `output`. If you use a different parameter name, the Chat trigger sends the entire object as its response, not just the value.\n\n/// note | Respond to Chat node\nWhen you are using a [Respond to Chat](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.respondtochat.md) node to manually create the response sent to the user, you must set the Chat Trigger response mode to 'Using Response Nodes'.\n///"
