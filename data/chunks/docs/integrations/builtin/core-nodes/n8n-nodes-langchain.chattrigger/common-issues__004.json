  "content": "## Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages\n\nWhen you configure a Chat Trigger node, you might experience problems fetching previous messages if you aren't careful about how you configure session loading. This often manifests as a `workflow could not be started!` error.\n\nIn Chat Triggers, the **Load Previous Session** option retrieves previous chat messages for a session using the `sessionID`. When you set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From memory**, it's almost always best to [connect the same memory node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/index.md#load-previous-session) to both the Chat Trigger and the Agent in your workflow:\n\n1. In your **Chat Trigger** node, set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From Memory**. This is only visible if you've made the chat publicly available.\n2. Attach a **Simple Memory** node to the **Memory** connector.\n3. Attach the same **Simple Memory** node to **Memory** connector of your **Agent**.\n4. In the **Simple Memory** node, set **Session ID** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node**.\n\nOne instance where you may want to attach separate memory nodes to your Chat Trigger and the Agent is if you want to set the **Session ID** in your memory node to **Define below**.\n\nIf you're retrieving the session ID from an expression, the same expression must work for each of the nodes attached to it. If the expression isn't compatible with each of the nodes that need memory, you might need to use separate memory nodes so you can customize the expression for the session ID on a per-node basis."
