Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.\n\nUse `*` (default) to allow all origins.\n\n#### Input Placeholder, Title, and Subtitle\n\nEnter the text for these elements in the chat interface.\n\n??? Details \"View screenshot\"\n\t![Customizable text elements](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/hosted-text-elements.png)\n\n#### Load Previous Session\n\nSelect whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.\n\nIf you select any option other than **Off**, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.\n\n??? Details \"View screenshot\"\n\t![Connect nodes to memory](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/connect-memory.png)\n\n#### Response Mode\n\nUse this option when building a workflow with steps after the agent or chain that's handling the chat. Choose from:\n\n* **When Last Node Finishes**: The Chat Trigger node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.\n* **Using Response Nodes**: The Chat Trigger node responds as defined in a [Respond to Chat](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.respondtochat.md) node or [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook.md) node. In this response mode, the Chat Trigger will solely show messages as defined in these nodes and not output the data from the last node executed in the workflow.\n\n/// note | Using Response Nodes\nThis mode replaces the 'Using Respond to Webhook Node' mode from version 1.2 of the Chat Trigger node.\n///\n\n#### Require Button Click to Start Chat\n\nSet whether to display a **New Conversation** button on the chat interface (turned on) or not (turned off).\n\n???
