You can see the metric results in your workflow's **Evaluations** tab.\n\nFor each metric you wish to record, you set the following details:\n\n* **Name**: The name to use for the metric.\n* **Value**: The numeric value to record. Once you run your evaluation, you can drag and drop values from previous nodes here. Metric values must be numeric."
