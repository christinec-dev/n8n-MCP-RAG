Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. \n\nThere are two ways to test:\n\n- Select **Execute Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node and any previous nodes, but not the rest of the workflow.\n- Select **Execute Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow."
