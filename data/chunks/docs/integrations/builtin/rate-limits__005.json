Enable the **Retry On Fail** toggle.\n1. Configure the retry settings: if using this to work around rate limits, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to more than the rate limit. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait."
