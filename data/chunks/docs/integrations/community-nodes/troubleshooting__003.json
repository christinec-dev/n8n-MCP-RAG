If the packages aren't available at startup, you get an error warning of missing packages.\n\nIf running n8n using Docker: depending on your Docker setup, you may lose the packages when you recreate your container or upgrade your n8n version. You must either:\n\n* Persist the contents of the `~/.n8n/nodes` directory. This is the best option. If you follow the [Docker installation](/hosting/installation/docker.md) guide, the setup steps include persisting this directory.\n* Set the `N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES` environment variable to `true`.\n\nThe second option might increase startup time and may cause health checks to fail."
