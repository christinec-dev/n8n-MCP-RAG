  "content": "# Risks when using community nodes\n\nInstalling community nodes from npm means you are installing unverified code from a public source into your n8n instance. This has some risks.\n\nRisks include:\n\n* System security: community nodes have full access to the machine that n8n runs on, and can do anything, including malicious actions.\n* Data security: any community node that you use has access to data in your workflows.\n* Breaking changes: node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes.\n\n/// note | n8n vets verified community nodes\nIn addition to publicly available community nodes from npm, n8n inspects some nodes and makes them available as [verified community node inside the nodes panel](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/verified-install.md). These nodes have to meet a set of data and system security requirements for approval.\n///"
