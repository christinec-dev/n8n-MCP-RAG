The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management. All members of an n8n instance can use already installed community nodes in their workflows.\n\nAdmin accounts can also uninstall any community node, verified or unverified. This helps them remove problematic nodes that may affect the instance's health and functionality.\n///"
