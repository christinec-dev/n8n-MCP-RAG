  "content": "### Only set external secrets on credentials owned by an instance owner or admin\n\nDue to the permissions that instance owners and admins have, it's possible for owners and admins to update credentials owned by another user with a secrets expression. This will appear to work in preview for an instance owner or admin, but the secret won't resolve when the workflow runs in production. \n\nOnly use external secrets for credentials that are owned by an instance admin or owner. This ensures they resolve correctly in production."
