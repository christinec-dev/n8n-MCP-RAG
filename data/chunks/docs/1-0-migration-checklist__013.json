Instead, you must install (or link) them to `~/.n8n/custom` (or a directory defined by `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`). Custom nodes that are npm packages will be located in `~/.n8n/nodes`.\nIf you have custom nodes that were linked using `npm link` into the global `node_modules` directory, you need to link them again, into `~/.n8n/nodes` instead.\n\n[PR #6396](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6396)"
