You can now connect multiple **AI Agent Tool** nodes to a primary **AI Agent** node, allowing it to supervise and delegate work across other specialized agents. \n\nThis setup is especially useful for building complex systems that function like real-world teams, where a lead agent assigns parts of a task to specialists. You can even add multiple layers of agents directing other agents, just like you would have in a real multi-tiered organizational structure.  It also helps with prompt management by letting you split long, complex instructions into smaller, focused tasks across multiple agents. While similar orchestration was already possible using sub-workflows, AI Agent Tool nodes are a good choice when you want the interaction to happen within a single execution or prefer to manage and debug everything from a single canvas.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è **How to:**\n\n- Add an **AI Agent** node to your workflow and click **+** to create a Tools connection.\n- Search for and select the **AI Agent Tool** node from the Nodes Panel.\n- Name the node clearly so the primary agent can reference it, then add a short description and prompt.\n- Connect any LLMs, memory, and tools the agent needs to perform its role.\n- Instruct the primary **AI Agent** on when to use the **AI Agent Tool** and to pass along relevant context in its prompt.\n\nüß† **Keep in mind:**\n\n- The orchestrating agent does not pass full execution context by default. Any necessary context must be included in the prompt.\n\n**AI Agent Tool** nodes makes it easier to build layered, agent-to-agent workflows without relying on sub-workflows, helping you move faster when building and debugging multi-agent systems.\n\n<br>\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n    ![](/_images/release-notes/AI_Agent_Tool.png)\n    <figcaption>AI Agent Tool node</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br>"
