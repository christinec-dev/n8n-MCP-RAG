With sub-workflows, you can take a more modular approach, breaking up big workflows into smaller, manageable parts that are easier to reuse, test, understand, and explain.\n\nUntil now, creating sub-workflows required copying and pasting nodes manually, setting up a new workflow from scratch, and reconnecting everything by hand. **Convert to sub-workflow** allows you to simplify this process into a single action, so you can spend more time building and less time restructuring.\n\n<br>\n<video src=\"/_video/release-notes/convert_to_sub-workflow.mp4\" controls width=\"100%\"></video>\n<br>\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. Highlight the nodes you want to convert to a sub-workflow. These must:\n    - Be fully connected, meaning no missing steps in between them\n    - Start from a single starting node\n    - End with a single node\n2. Right-click to open the context menu and select **Convert to sub-workflow**\n    - Or use the shortcut: `Alt + X`\n3. n8n will:\n    - Open a new tab containing the selected nodes\n    - Preserve all node parameters as-is\n    - Replace the selected nodes in the original workflow with a **Call My Sub-workflow** node\n\n*Note*: You will need to manually adjust the field types in the Start and Return nodes in the new sub-workflow.\n\nThis makes it easier to keep workflows modular, performant, and easier to maintain.\n\nLearn more about [sub-workflows](/flow-logic/subworkflows.md).\n\nThis release contains performance improvements and bug fixes."
