We surround the code in both the handlebar brackets for an expression and the IIFE syntax.\n\n\n```js\n{{(()=>{\n  let end = DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13');\n  let start = DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13');\n  let diffInMonths = end.diff(start, 'months');\n  return diffInMonths.toObject();\n})()}}\n```"
