There's an [n8n API node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n.md) to access the API in your workflows.\n\n\t[:octicons-arrow-right-24: API](/api/index.md)\n\n- __Self-host__\n\n\tYou can self-host n8n. This keeps your data on your own infrastructure.\n\n\t[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Hosting](/hosting/index.md)\n\n- __Build your own nodes__\n\n\tYou can build custom nodes, install them on your n8n instance, and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).\n\n\t[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Creating nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/overview.md)\n\n</div>"
