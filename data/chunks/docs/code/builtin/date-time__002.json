Equivalent to `DateTime.now()`. | :white_check_mark: |\n\t| `$today` | A Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day.

Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon.md) for more information.\n\nn8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates.
