Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.\n1. Set **Type** to **Query**.\n1. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API and is usually described in its documentation. For example, some APIs use a query parameter named `page` to set the page. So **Name** would be `page`.\n1. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.\n1. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`\n\n`$pageCount` is the number of pages the HTTP Request node has fetched. It starts at zero. Most API pagination counts from one (the first page is page one). This means that adding `+1` to `$pageCount` means the node fetches page one on its first loop, page two on its second, and so on."
