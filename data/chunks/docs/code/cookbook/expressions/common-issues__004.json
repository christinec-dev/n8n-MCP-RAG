  "content": "## Can't get data for expression\n\nThis error occurs when n8n can't retrieve the data referenced by an expression. Often, this happens when the preceding node hasn't been run yet.\n\nAnother variation of this may appear as `Referenced node is unexecuted`.  In that case, the full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format:\n\n> An expression references the node '&lt;node-name&gt;', but it hasnâ€™t been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first.\n> \n\nTo begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node.\n\nFor nodes that use JavaScript or other custom code, you can check if a previous node has executed before trying to use its value by checking the following:\n\n```javascript\n$(\"<node-name>\").isExecuted\n```\n\nAs an example, this JSON references the parameters of the input data. This error will display if you test this step without connecting it to another node:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"my_field_1\": {{ $input.params }}\n}\n```"
