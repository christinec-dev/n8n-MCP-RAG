Depending on the problem with the JSON object, the error sometimes display as `The 'JSON Output' in item 0 does not contain a valid JSON object`.\n\nTo resolve this, make sure that the code you provide is valid JSON:\n\n- Check the JSON with a [JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/).\n- Check that your JSON object doesn't reference undefined input data. This may occur if the incoming data doesn't always include the same fields."
