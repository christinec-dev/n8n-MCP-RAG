It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.\n\t* `toObject()` turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {\"days\":-<number-of-days>}]`. For example, on 9th March, `[Object: {\"days\":-291}]`.\n\t* `.days` uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our [JMESpath](/code/cookbook/jmespath.md) documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.\n\t* `.toString().substring(1)` turns the number into a string and removes the `-`.\n\t* `+ \" days to Christmas!\"`: another string, with a `+` to join it to the previous string."
