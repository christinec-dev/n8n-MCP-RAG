  "content": "## Date and time behavior in n8n\n\nBe aware of the following:\n\n* In a workflow, n8n converts dates and times to strings between nodes. Keep this in mind when doing arithmetic on dates and times from other nodes.\n* With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\")`."
