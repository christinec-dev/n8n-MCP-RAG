They allow node parameters to be set dynamically based on data from:\n\n- Previous node executions\n- The workflow\n- Your n8n environment\n\nYou can also execute JavaScript within an expression, making this a convenient and easy way to manipulate data into useful parameter values without writing extensive extra code.\n\nn8n created and uses a templating language called [Tournament](https://github.com/n8n-io/tournament), and extends it with [custom methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview.md) and [data transformation functions](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/index.md). These features make it easier to perform common tasks like getting data from other nodes or accessing workflow metadata.\n\nn8n additionally supports two libraries:\n\n- [Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/), for working with dates and time.\n- [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/), for querying JSON.\n\n/// note | Data in n8n\nWhen writing expressions, it's helpful to understand data structure and behavior in n8n. Refer to [Data](/data/index.md) for more information on working with data in your workflows.\n///"
