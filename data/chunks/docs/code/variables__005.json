If the variable has no value, n8n treats its value as `undefined`. Workflows don't automatically fail in this case.\n\nVariables are read-only. You must use the UI to change the values. If you need to set and access custom data within your workflow, use [Workflow static data](/code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data.md)."
